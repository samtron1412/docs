# Overview

Mathematics (from Greek, "knowledge, study, learning") is the language
of universe and the natural basic science.

# History

## Etymology

# Definitions of Mathematics

## Normal definitions

- Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers),
  structure, space, and change.

## Greater abstraction - Philosophical definitions

- Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions.

# Inspiration and aesthetics


# Notation, language, and rigor

# Fields of Mathematics

- Mathematics can be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure,
space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis).
- In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions.

## Foundations

### Mathematical logic

Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the
applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics.

### Set theory

Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections
of objects.

### Category theory

Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical
structures and relationships between them, is still in development.

### Theory of computation

In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of
computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can
be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is
divided into three major branches: automata theory and language,
computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are
linked by the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and
limitations of computers?"

## Pure mathematics

### Change

+ [Analysis vs. Calculus](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/32433/are-calculus-and-real-analysis-the-same-thing)

- Analysis
    + Differential equations
- Calculus

- Mathematical chemistry
- Mathematical economics
- Control theory

# Mathematical awards

- Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields
  Medal, established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around
  World War II) to as many as four individuals.
