# Overview

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of
algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values "true"
and "false", usually denoted "1" and "0" respectively.
- Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are
  numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the
  main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction "AND", the
  disjunction "OR", and the negation "NOT."
- It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same
  way that ordinary algebra describes numeric relations.
- Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book *The
  Mathematical Analysis of Logic* (1987), and set forth more fully in
  his *An Investigation of the Laws of Thought* (1854).
