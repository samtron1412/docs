# Overview

- Vectors play a role in nearly all areas of mathematics and its
applications.
- In physical settings, they are used to represent quantities that have
both magnitude and direction, such as velocity and force.
    + Newtonian mechanics, quantum physics, and special and general
    relativity all depend fundamentally on vectors.
    + We could not understand electricity and magnetism without vectors,
    which are used in constructing the theoretical framework.
- Vectors also play a critical role in computer graphics, describing how
light should be depicted, and providing a means to change the viewpoint
of the screen appropriately.
- Fields such as economics and statistics use vectors to encapsulate
information in a manner that provides for efficient manipulation.
