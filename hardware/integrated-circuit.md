# Overview

An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to
as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one
small flat piece of semiconductor material, normally silicon.
- The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip
  resulted in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper,
  and faster than those constructed of discrete electronic components.
- Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed
  as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one
  transistor at a time. Furthermore,packaged ICs use much less material
  than discrete circuits.
- Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and
  consume little power because of their small size and close proximity.
- The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to design them and
  fabricate the required photomasks.
