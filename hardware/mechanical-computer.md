# Overview

A mechanical computer is built from mechanical components such as levers
and gears, rather than electronic components.
- The most common examples are adding machines and mechanical counters,
  which use the turning of gears to increment output displays.

# Examples

- The Antikythera mechanism
- Pascaline, 1642 - Blaise Pascal's arithmetic machine
- Stepped Reckoner, 1672 - Gottfried Leibniz's mechanical calculator
  that could add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
- Difference Engine, 1822 - Charles Babbage's mechanical device to
  calculate polynomials.
- Analytical Engine, 1837 - A later Charles Babbage device that could be
said to encapsulate most of the elements of modern computers.

# Electro-mechanical computers

Early electrically powered computers constructed from switches and
relays rather than vacuum tubes (thermionic valves) or transistors
(from which later electronic computers were constructed) are classified
as electro-mechanical computers.
- Z2, 1939
- Z3, 1941
- Harvard Mark I, 1944 - Built by IBM
- Harry Porter's Relay computer, [2005][harry]
