- Team Charter template: https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/44769/Documents/PDF_FILES/A%20Guide%20to%20Writing%20your%20Team's%20Charter.pdf
- A team charter is a written document created to provide the true
  “North Star” for a team.
    + Holding team members, including leadership, accountable to all the
      same principles
    + Spelling out roles and responsibilities in a clear, measurable way
    + Defining operations, including ways to adapt to change, address
      roadblocks, and even define actions like attendance
    + Demonstrating the team’s purpose and mission transparently to
      others in the organization
    + Providing clarity and reducing confusion in cases where
      conflicting asks or projects arise

> "A big risk to not having a charter is inertia. In other words, the
> loudest or most intimidating team member may end up pushing forward
> his or her agenda. And this isn't what the entire team signed up for."

- Team Purpose (Mission)
    + The reason for the team's existence
    + Why you come to work
    + The core business activity
- Verifiable/Measurable Goals
    + There are two different types of goals your team could develop: 1)
      Work plan goals and 2) Process improvement goals.
        * Your team work plan goals will define what is to be achieved
          by when and should include timelines, deliverables,
          checkpoints, tracking and measurement.
        * Process improvement goals will define what is to be improved,
          by how much, and when results should be accomplished. Typical
          process improvement goals focus on reducing
          bottlenecks/delays/hand-offs, reducing costs, increasing
          safety, and improving the quality of work.
    + Key points
        * Is the goal statement easy to understand?
        * Is it specific and measurable?
        * Can everyone on the team live with it?
        * Is it achievable?
        * If we accomplish it, will it make a difference in our success?
    + Your team goals should be SMART -- specific, measurable, agreed
      upon in writing, realistic, time activated and tracked.
- Operating Guidelines
    + Code of conduct and safe environment
    + Meeting guidelines
    + Decision making guidelines
    + Conflict resolution process
    + Workload distribution
    + Internal and external communications

> Once your team charter is complete, every team member and the team
> sponsor / manager should sign it. You might be tempted to skip this
> step, but it’s very important. The act of signing the charter is very
> powerful in helping each of the team members commit to those items
> agreed upon by the team.
