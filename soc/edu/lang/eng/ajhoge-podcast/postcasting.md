My first experiment with podcasting has been fairly successful.

However, *I've been having a lot of* problems with my podcast host, "Solidcasts", lately. *Turns out* they are anything but solid. At the moment, I'm unable to upload audio and thus unable to publish more podcast episodes.

So *I've decided* to change my podcast and feed. I've signed up with "**Liberated Syndication**", which seems to be more reliable. *I'll be changing* my podcast feed soon- and will hopefully then be up and running.

In addition to changing the host, *I'll be making* other changes:

1. I will have a separate webpage/blog for the podcast. I'll continue to post them on this blog as well, of course. But I'll also have another page which will only have the podcasts-- nothing else. Hopefully this will be more convenient for students who are interested in the podcasts, but *don't care to wade through* and read all my teaching-oriented posts.

2. *I'll be gradually mixing the content* of the podcasts to make them more useful to English language learners. Primarily, this means adding natural, unscripted conversations between native speakers. I just ordered a small digital voice recorder and will start carrying it with me everywhere. I plan to record conversations with my friends, with waiters, with co-workers, with strangers.

3. In the more distant future, I plan to offer full transcripts and study guides for all podcast audio-- especially the natural unscripted conversations. The study guide will have word for word text of the audio, and also explanations of difficult *idioms, phrases, and slang.*

*Unfortunately*, I will have to charge a token monthly subscription fee for these guides. It takes me a VERY long time to transcribe conversations. To have the time to do this, I must reduce my teaching hours (and thus my pay)-- so I must be able to *recoup that somehow*. I'll probably charge about $5 a month for this.

4. In a few months time, each study guide will also include Japanese translations of key vocabulary, idioms, slang, and phrases. I (we) may also add Japanese audio explanations of more difficult material as additional study guides (available for subscribers).

In general, I hope to provide the kind of resource *I have been craving for my own Spanish language* study: Real, unplanned, unscripted conversations between native speakers- with a full text transcript, convenient word & phrase lists (with translations in my native language), and easy to understand explanations of difficult slang/idioms/phrases.

This kind of resource is important. Textbook dialogues are scripted, unnatural, and slow. *They do not* include any of the common idioms (phrases) used by native speakers in everyday conversation.

Audiobooks and articles are excellent resources. I highly recommend using them. However, they do have a weakness- they are essentially written English- recorded in audio form. Thus, the style of most audiobooks and audio articles is *much more formal than true*, natural conversations. Classroom English is also much different than conversational English as used by native speakers.

*I suddenly realized this* at the end of a lesson with one of my students. We had just finished and my phone rang. I answered it and had a short talk with a (native speaker) friend while my student collected her notebooks. When I *hung up the phone*, my student seemed surprised.

She said, "I think you are very easy to understand. I always understand when you talk to me. But when you talked to your friend now, I couldn't understand anything!"

I thought about it and realized she is right- I speak very differently when chatting with native speakers. I talk faster, I use common idioms and slang, and I don't use complete sentences all the time. *I'm not* using a lot of slang, or unusual slang, but I *do use* a very different kind of English than what I use with students. *In other words*, I use everyday conversational English-- the one thing that is never taught in language schools!

This is a very serious weakness. We need more materials to help English learners understand English *as it is actually used*. Not *as the textbooks tell us it should be* -- but *as it actually is*.

**In the future, I hope my podcast can be one such learning resource.**
