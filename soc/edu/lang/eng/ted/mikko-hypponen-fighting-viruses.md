0:16   love
0:17   the internet
0:19   it's true
0:20   think about everything you just brought us
0:22   think about
0:24   all the citizens we use
0:26   all the connectivity
0:27   holding entertain
0:28   menthol the business all the commerce
0:32   and it's happening
0:34   during our lifetimes
0:36   i'm pretty sure when they will be
0:38   writing history books
0:40   hundreds of years from now
0:42   this time
0:43   power generation will be remembered
0:46   as the generation that got online
0:49   the generation
0:51   the built something really and truly clue
0:54   but yes
0:56   is also through
0:57   but the internet has problems there is serious problems
1:00   problems
1:02   with security
1:04   the problems with privacy
1:06   might spend
1:07   my career
1:09   fighting these problems
1:12   so let me show you something
1:16   this year
1:20   floppy disk five quarter-inch floppy disk infected by brain update
1:25   the first by the recipient of foam for pc compute
1:30   but we actually no
1:32   where brain came from
1:35   because it says self inside the codes
1:38   let's take a look
1:46   all right
1:48   that's the most sector of an infected flopping and if we actually
1:52   take a closer look
1:54   inside will see that right there is actually says
1:57   welcome to the dungeon
2:00   and that continues saying uh... nineteen eighty-six bossy and um...
2:06   and i think that i am dot our first mix
2:09   pakistani
2:10   first names in fact is a phone number
2:12   and address
2:13   put
2:18   not
2:20   nineteen eighty-six now it's twenty eleven
2:23   beth twenty five years ago two-piece evolves problem
2:26   is twenty five years old
2:29   soma poppy aerodrome i decided to go to pakistan myself
2:34   so let's see just couple of photos i took what i was in pakistan disease from
2:38   the city of the whole record is around three hundred kilometers south from
2:42   about the barber been london was called
2:44   is typical
2:45   straight use and your speed straight or roads leading into this building which
2:50   is
2:51   seven three zero the somewhat of michael com
2:54   and i'm not on the door
2:58   you what i guess who opened the door
3:00   nothing and objects they are still there
3:09   sudhir standing up his bosses
3:12   sitting down he's he's brother roundups these other guys who broke the first
3:16   easy marks
3:17   now of course
3:19   we had a very interesting discussion
3:20   uh... i i i said why master mojave feel about what they started
3:25   and uh... i got some sort of satisfaction from learning that both
3:30   musty and and dot have had their computers in fact the dozens of times by
3:35   completely unrelated other viruses
3:37   over these years so there is
3:39   there some sort of justice in the world after all
3:45   the viruses that we used to seeing in the nineteen eighties in nineteen
3:48   ninety-four muesli
3:50   or not a problem anymore
3:52   so let me just show you couple examples what they used to look like
3:55   but i'm running here has a system that enables me to run
3:59   he told programs in the modern computer with just a miles and rise
4:05   go over there and what we have here is the least of
4:08   although i was so let me just run some buyers is on the computer for example
4:11   uh...
4:13   let's go with the centipede virus first time you come see the top of the screen
4:17   there's a centipede scrolling across your computer when you get infected by
4:21   this when you know and respected because back to you
4:24   shows up
4:25   here's another one because of our schools crash within russia in nineteen
4:29   ninety two
4:31   let me show you one which actually makes stones
4:40   and elastic sample guess what they will provide the stars
4:44   yes there's a guy walking across the screen must get infected
4:48   so in used to be
4:50   fairly easy the military infected by a virus
4:54   when the buyer is very thin by hobbyists and teenagers
4:58   today
4:59   there are no longer
5:00   being written but will be some teenagers
5:03   today viruses are local problem
5:05   what we have here in the background is an example of our systems that we run
5:09   all absolutely
5:10   tracked virus infections worldwide so we've actually seen will probably just
5:14   walked by receiving sweden in taiwan
5:17   russia and elsewhere
5:19   in fact
5:21   to try to put it back to our lab systems
5:23   through the web
5:25   we can see in real time
5:27   just some kind of idea of how many viruses how many news
5:30   examples of mild where we find every single day
5:32   here's the latest virus we found in a file called civility extn we found it
5:38   right over here three seconds ago the previous one sixty seconds ago
5:41   and if we just stroll around
5:44   itself
5:46   it's just massive we find tens of thousands even hundreds of thousands
5:50   that's the last twenty minutes of my where every single day
5:54   so where
5:55   are all these coming from that
5:57   well up to date
5:59   uh... it's the organized criminal gangs writing viruses because they make money
6:04   with their viruses
6:05   it's guys like uh...
6:07   let's go to guys the bugs dot com
6:10   stay
6:11   website operating in moscow where
6:14   these guys are actually buying infected computers
6:17   so if you are a virus wider and you're capable of
6:20   in windows computers but you don't know what to do with that you can't sell
6:24   those infected computers somebody else's computers
6:27   but these dots and the election
6:29   pay you money for those companies
6:31   so how do these guys then monetize those infected computers
6:37   boulders multiple different ways such as banking trojans which will steal money
6:41   from your online banking accounts when you do online banking
6:44   or
6:45   kilos
6:47   delivers
6:48   silently seek on your computer hidden from view
6:52   and the report everything it's hot
6:54   so you're sitting on your computer
6:56   you're doing a little searches every single google searches heightened saved
7:00   and send for the criminals
7:02   every single email your right to be saved
7:04   and sent to the criminals same thing with every single cause for dance all
7:08   but the thing that they're actually looking for most our sessions where you
7:12   go online and do online courtesies in your life support
7:16   this when you do for a decision online store you will be typing in your name
7:20   the delivery address your credit card number and the credit card security code
7:24   so thats
7:25   is an example for firewood phone from the server couple weeks ago that's the
7:29   credit card number does the expiration date that the security code investing
7:32   and if the owner of the car
7:34   once again access to other people's credit card information you can just go
7:38   online and by whatever you want with these information
7:42   and that's obviously is a problem we now have a happy home
7:46   all of the problems marketplace brenda
7:49   these mystical systems built the wrong online crime
7:54   what's up with all these guys actually
7:56   not capable of monetize their operations
7:59   the go and have a look at the pages of interpol and search for want the purses
8:04   with fine guys like yours cindy originally from sweden
8:07   and his partner in crime also listed on the edge of poor want the pages
8:12   mister shot escobar gain u_s_ season
8:15   these guys were running a tone operation called on union cybercrime operation for
8:19   which they get the millions they're both
8:22   right now on ron goldman of where they are
8:26   u_s_ officials just a couple weeks ago froze
8:29   a swiss bank account belonging to mister jane
8:32   that backgrounds had fourteen dot nine million u_s_ dollars on it
8:37   so the amount of money
8:38   online crime generates fees
8:40   significant and that means that the only criminals
8:43   can actually afforded to invest
8:45   in their attacks
8:46   we note that only criminals are hiring programmers hiring
8:50   testing people testing jericho having back-end systems with a sql database
8:56   and they can afford to watch how we were click on security people were
9:01   and tried to work their way around
9:03   in the security precautions they can do
9:05   and they also use
9:07   the global nature of internet to their advantage
9:10   and the internet
9:11   it's international that's what we call it the internet
9:15   and if it's not going to take a look at what's happening
9:18   in the online world
9:19   is the radio built by clarified networks which illustrates how one single mulder
9:23   family was able to move around the world
9:26   his operation believed to be originally from estonia moves around from one
9:29   country to another as soon as the website is quite perceptron sleep just
9:33   catch up these guys down there all the switch from one country
9:36   to another from one of the restriction to another moving around the world using
9:41   the fact that we don't have capability to clover leaf police
9:45   operations like this
9:47   to the internet is
9:48   ask if somebody would have given
9:49   free plane tickets diwali only criminals of the world now the criminals that were
9:54   stable
9:55   reaching us before
9:57   can reach us
9:58   so i had to go around finding online criminals howdy actually track them down
10:03   let me give you an example but we have here
10:06   is what it's worth while
10:08   here are looking at uh... hex dump of a image files which contains an exploited
10:14   that basically means that you tried to view this image file on your windows
10:17   computer jackson takes over your computer and runs coke
10:21   but at the close to look at these in its final destination header
10:25   and they're the actual co
10:27   route off the attack starts and that could have been pretty it's over
10:31   that's depicted because we think replete with that x_ or function ninety seven
10:36   you just have to believe me these cities
10:39   we can go here and actually started pretty good
10:43   though the yellow part of the code is now the creepy and i know he doesn't
10:46   really look much different from the original but just
10:48   keeps staring at you like to see the town here
10:51   you can see your wet address union seatbelt on slash b
10:56   slats fight overloaded alexi and when you do you just image on your computer
11:00   tax is going to run
11:02   donald and one of the program and at the back door which will take over your
11:05   computer
11:07   but even more interestingly if we continue depicting
11:10   will find this mysterious strain would say yes
11:13   over six hundred cable seventy arguments
11:17   that coaches their underneath the encryption essence of the first thing
11:21   that you it's abused for anything and i was looking at that and trying to figure
11:25   out what it means
11:26   so obviously i googled for it
11:28   part of the rights wasn't there
11:31   so i spoke with the guys in the last time we have couple of russian doesn't
11:34   eleven and one of the mentioned above the a_n_c_ arguments what russia
11:38   alright and
11:39   seventy eight
11:40   is to see the code for the city of saint petersburg for example you can find it
11:43   from some poll numbers and then car license plates and stuff but that
11:47   so i'm looking for contacts in saint petersburg
11:51   went through a long road we eventually
11:54   this one party color website
11:56   here's his russian guy who's been operating on line for a number of years
12:00   who runs his own website and iran's a blog on their depot glory light jornal
12:04   analyst low-key what about his life aboutus life in saint petersburg he's in
12:09   his early twenties tomorrow he's cash
12:12   about his girlfriend
12:14   but he drives a very nice car in fact this guy drives the
12:19   mercedes-benz yes
12:21   six hundred to be twelve we they six liter engine with more than four hundred
12:25   horsepower
12:27   but that's a nice car for a twenty-something old keep in some peeps
12:31   for
12:32   how do i know about the spark because he blocked about the car
12:35   he actually
12:36   headed car accident in downtown saint petersburg he actually crashed
12:40   his car into another party any public images about the car accident that's his
12:44   mercedes
12:46   right here is the a lot of some are unprecedented
12:50   and you can actually see that the license plate off the summer rains in
12:52   seventy eight are u_s_ if they actually take a look at the uh...
12:56   seen pictures you can see that the
12:58   plate off the mercedes these po six hundred kato seventy-eight are u_s_
13:05   now
13:06   i'm not a lawyer but if i would be
13:09   this is where i would say high-interest my case
13:14   so what happens when the phone like criminals are actually caught well in
13:18   most cases actually never gets his farm vast majority of the online crime cases
13:22   we don't even know
13:24   which continent the attacks are coming from an even if we are able to find
13:27   online criminals quite often there is no
13:29   outcome the local police doesn't act or if they do there's no turning up
13:32   evidence
13:33   or for some reason we can take them down
13:36   it would be easier
13:38   unfortunately decent
13:40   are also changing
13:42   as a very rapid pace
13:45   you've all heard about things like stocks
13:48   so with a look at what stocks and actually did he studied it in fact the
13:52   these that's a
13:54   cements
13:55   is seven four hundred d_l_c_ programmable logic computer avast
14:00   is what runs our infrastructure
14:01   disease what runs
14:03   everything around us peel sees these lol book seize which have no display no no
14:08   keyboard it's appropriate are put in place and they do their job for trouble
14:12   elevators in this building most likely are controlled by one of these
14:18   when stocks i think that's one of these
14:20   that's
14:21   the massive revolution on the kinds of risks we have to worry about because
14:25   everything around us is being run by stormy we have
14:29   critical infrastructure development
14:31   any factory any power plant
14:33   a chemical plant any food processing plant you look around
14:37   everything
14:38   is being run by computers
14:39   everything
14:40   is being run by computers everything is reliant on these computers work and we
14:44   have become
14:45   very reliance
14:48   internet
14:49   on basic things like illiquidity obviously
14:52   on computers working
14:54   and he's really something which creates a completely new problems for us
14:58   we must have somewhere
15:00   both continuing to work
15:02   even if computers for it
15:13   pan
15:24   so prepared this means that we can do stuff
15:27   even when the things that we take for granted
15:31   party recycling very basic stuff begin both continued it begin not that helps
15:36   thing about the things
15:37   but actually matter
15:39   now
15:40   i told you
15:45   i love the internet
15:47   i do think about other services we have
15:51   and think about if they are
15:52   taken away from you
15:54   if one day you don't actually have been for some reason
15:58   i see beauty
16:00   in the future of the internet
16:01   bunbury
16:03   that we might not see that
16:05   i'm very glad we are running into problems because upon one crime online
16:09   crime
16:10   is the one thing that might take these things away from
16:17   i've spent my life
16:21   and i do fail
16:22   they they don't quite online crime
16:25   we are
16:26   running the risk of losing it all
16:28   we have to do this
16:31   and we have to do it
16:32   right now
16:34   what we need
16:36   is more culpable
16:37   international law enforcement work
16:39   defined ongoing criminal gangs he's organized gangs that are making millions
16:44   artifacts
16:46   that's much more important than you know running on the virus he's running
16:48   firewalls lakshi matters
16:51   is actually fighting the people behind these attacks
16:53   and even more importantly
16:55   we have to find the people who
16:58   or about the com part of these online worlds
17:01   of crime but haven't yet
17:03   dont we have to find the people week the skills weed out the opportunities
17:08   and even then
17:09   the opportunities
17:11   the use their skills
17:13   the correct
