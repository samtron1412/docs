# Different between
## [Goal vs Purpose (Mục tiêu vs Mục đích)](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-purpose-and-goal/)
- Goal: answer for question `what? and how?`
	* Mục tiêu là cái mà chủ thể xác định, định hướng cho hoạt động của mình. (trả lời câu hỏi làm cái gì? thực hiện cái gì).
- Purpose: answer for question `"why do this thing"; "the reason for which something is done, created or exists"`
	* Mục đích là ý nghĩa thực tiễn được chủ thể xác định trước khi làm. (trả lời cho câu hỏi làm cho ai? để làm gì?).

1. People try to reach their goals by setting deadlines. On the other hand, deadlines are not applicable in purposes.

2. Goal can be called as the point one wishes to achieve. On the other hand, purpose can be called as the reason one aims at to achieve a goal.

3. Unlike a goal, a purpose is broader and deeper.

4. Goals can be measured whereas purposes cannot be measured.

5. Goals have a specific target. On the other hand, purposes do not have a specific aim.

6. Purpose can be termed as a fundamental need of a human being which gives a meaning to their actions. There is always a purpose behind all goals.

7. In goals, the end result can be seen whereas in purpose, it is not that visible.

## [Goal vs Objective](http://www.diffen.com/difference/Goal_vs_Objective)
Goals are broader than objectives in the sense that goals are general intentions and are not specific enough to be measured. Objectives are narrow and are set for certain tasks in particular.

## [Ambition vs Passion](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101114031745AAU9GKH)
**Ambition** is something you want to achieve, and therefore implies some degree of forethought and planning.

**Passion** is an emotion that makes you feel strongly about something; you don't plan for it.
