# Overview

- A heuristic technique is any approach to problem solving, learning, or
discovery that employs a practical method not guaranteed to be optimal
or perfect but sufficient for the immediate goals.
- Examples of this method include using a rule of thumb, an educated
guess, an intuitive judgment, stereotyping, profiling, or common sense.
