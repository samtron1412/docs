# [Wikimedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org)
Our projects are the core of the [Wikimedia movement](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_movement). All major projects of the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/About_Wikimedia) are collaboratively developed by users around the world using the [MediaWiki](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Our_projects#MediaWiki) software. All contributions are released under a [free Creative Commons license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Creative_Commons_license), meaning that any project content may be freely used, edited, copied, and redistributed, subject to the terms of the license. A full listing of Wikimedia projects is available here: [Special:SiteMatrix](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Special:SiteMatrix).

>As Wikimedia Foundation founder Jimmy Wales put it: "Imagine a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge."

## [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)
Wikipedia is a project to build free encyclopedias in all languages of the world. Virtually anyone with Internet access is free to contribute by contributing neutral, cited information.

Wikipedia started in January 2001, and currently offers more than 24 million articles written in 284 languages.

## [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/)
Wiktionary is a project to create a multilingual free content dictionary in every language. This means each project seeks to use a particular language to define all words in all languages. It actually aims to be much more extensive than a typical dictionary, including thesauri, rhymes, translations, audio pronunciations, etymologies, and quotations. The project started in December 2002.

## [Wikiquote](https://www.wikiquote.org/)
Wikiquote is a repository of quotations taken from famous people, books, speeches, films or any intellectually interesting materials. Proverbs, mnemonics or slogans are also included in Wikiquote. The project started in July 2003.

## [Wikibooks](https://www.wikibooks.org/)
Wikibooks aims to build a collection of free e-book resources, including textbooks, language courses, manuals, and annotated public domain books. It aims to help both (self-)instruction of students and teachers in high schools and universities.

## [Wikisource](https://wikisource.org/)
Wikisource is a multilingual project, started in November 2003, to archive a collection of free and open content texts. It is not only a superior format for storing classics, laws, and other free works as hypertext, but it also serves as a base for translating these texts.

## [Wikispecies](https://species.wikimedia.org/)
Wikispecies is an open, wiki-based project to provide a central, more extensive species database for taxonomy. Launched 14 September 2004, Wikispecies is aimed specifically at the needs of scientific users.

## [Wikivoyage](https://www.wikivoyage.org/)
Wikivoyage aims to create the world's largest free, complete and up-to-date world-wide travel guide. Wikivoyage was launched in January 2013 and is written by volunteers in the same spirit of sharing knowledge that makes travel so enjoyable.

## [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/)
Wikimedia Commons was launched in September 2004 to provide a central repository for free photographs, diagrams, maps, videos, animations, music, sounds, spoken texts, and other free media. It is a multilingual project with contributors speaking dozens of languages, that serves as a central repository for all Wikimedia projects.

## [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)
*A secondary database*. Wikidata can record not just statements, but also their sources, thus reflecting the diversity of knowledge available and supporting the notion of verifiability.

*Collecting structured data*. Unlike Wikimedia Commons, which collects media files, and the Wikipedias, which produce encyclopedic articles, Wikidata will collect data, in a structured form. This will allow easy reuse of that data by Wikimedia projects and third parties, and will enable computers to easily process and “understand” it.

## [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/)
The MediaWiki open source community maintains several software projects. The MediaWiki engine is used by all Wikimedia projects and many other sites. Its core functionality can be expanded through extensions, customizations, and mobile applications.

## [Meta-Wiki](https://meta.wikimedia.org/)
Place to discuss develop Wikimedia.

## [Wikimedia Incubator](https://incubator.wikimedia.org/)
The Wikimedia Incubator is a wiki used for developing new wikis.

## [Wikimedia Labs](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/)
Wikimedia Labs is a project aimed to help volunteers get involved in Wikimedia operations and software development, and to make it easier for system administrators and developers to try out improvements to Wikimedia infrastructure, including MediaWiki. Wikitech is a site for internal technical documentation of Wikimedia infrastructure, and it is connected with the Wikimedia Labs project.

## Style
### Layout
#### [The lead section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section)
The lead section may contain optional elements presented in the following order:
1. Disambiguation links (dablinks)
2. Deletion tags (CSD, PROD, and AFD notices)
3. Maintenance tags
4. Infoboxes
5. Foreign character warning boxes
6. Images
7. Navigational boxes (navigational templates)
8. Introductory text
9. Table of contents moving to the heading of the first section

#### [Body section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Section)
##### [Headings and sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style#Article_titles.2C_headings.2C_and_sections)
##### [Section template and summary style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Layout#Section_templates_and_summary_style)
##### [Paragraphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Paragraphs)

#### [Footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Footnotes)
##### Works or publications
**Contents**: A bulleted list, usually ordered chronologically, of the works created by the subject of the article.

**Title**: Many different titles are used, depending on the subject matter. "*Works*" is preferred when the list includes items that are not written publications (e.g., music, films, paintings, choreography, or architectural designs), or if multiple types of works are included.

##### See also
**Contents**: A bulleted list of internal links to related Wikipedia articles. Consider using `{{Columns-list}}` or `{{Div col}}` if the list is lengthy. The links in the "See also" section do not have to be directly related to the topic of the article because one purpose of "See also" links is to enable readers to explore tangentially related topics.

**Other internal links**: `{{Portal}}` and `{{Wikipedia books}}` links are usually placed in this section.

**Title**: The most common title for this section is "*See also*".

##### [Notes and References](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)
**Contents**: This section, or series of sections, may contain any or all of the following:
1. [explanatory footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:EXPLNOTE) that give information which is too detailed or awkward to be in the body of the article,
2. [citation footnotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:INCITE) (either short citations or full citations) that connect specific material in the article with specific sources,
3. full citations to sources, if short citations are used in the footnotes, or
4. [general references](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CITE#General_references) (full bibliographic citations to sources that were consulted in writing the article but that are not explicitly connected to any specific material in the article).

**Title**: If multiple sections are wanted, then some possibilities include:

- for a list of explanatory footnotes or shortened citation footnotes: "Notes", "Endnotes", or "Footnotes"
- for a list of full citations or general references: "References" or "Works cited"

##### Further reading
**Contents**: An optional bulleted list, usually alphabetized, of a reasonable number of publications that would help interested readers learn more about the article subject.

##### [External links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:External_links)
**Contents**: A bulleted list of recommended relevant websites, each accompanied by a short description.

**Links to sisters projects**: Links to Wikimedia sister projects and `{{Spoken Wikipedia}}` should generally appear in "External links", not under "See also". Two exceptions are Wiktionary and Wikisource links that may even be linked inline (e.g., to the text of a document being discussed or to a word that might not be familiar to all readers).

##### [Navigation template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories,_lists,_and_navigation_templates#Navigation_templates)
**Contents**: Navigation templates (footer navboxes), including succession boxes and geography boxes such as `{{Geographic location}}`. Most navboxes do not appear in printed versions of Wikipedia articles.
