# General Skills Obtained through Research

- Working on open-ended projects (vs. most course-work)
    - intuition for when an approach is reaching its limitations, a
    direction is a dead-end, versus will just require more work to get
    there
- ability to pick up new advanced concepts
- ability to decide what problems are worth working on
    + what are its impacts?
- Research process
    + identify limitations of current approaches
    + come up with an idea to address a limitation
        * studying existing tools
        * from problems you really want to solve
    + no tractable solution in generality
        * think about regimes in which a technique might excel
            - the domain my idea is good
        * experiment with illustrative examples
        * benchmark
    + if successful, write paper, otherwise try again
- Why is real undergraduate research involvement so challenging?
    + math
    + tools
    + research papers: keep reading 10 - 20 papers -> revisit the first
    one and things fall into places => take time
- How to be productive/successful?
    + keep healthy
    + working hard
    + foundation: ee263, cs229, ee364a, cs287
        * without those, you will be held back at some point, and you
        probably won't even realize when you are
    + looking up tips
        * how to be a good PhD student (in CS/AI/Robotics)?
        * how to read a paper?
        * how to write a paper? (Jennifer Widom! - Stanford)
- How to find a research position?
    + reaching out to professors: proactive
        * email, office hours (face-to-face)
            - different between professors to professors
        * graduate students
    + beehive
    + sense of inititive (try things)
    + I don't know how to connect with you. Sending email or office
    hours, how can I connect with you. I interested in doing research
    robotics and AI. What your criteria, or requirements to do research
    in your areas?
    + I studied this and this on my own, I think it is a good fit for
    the project
    + asking professors or graduate students
- something that I want to add on is
