# The General Layout of a Thesis
- Improve the readability and appearance of your thesis by following a few simple rules.
- The *golden rule* is to be **consistent**; choose one style and stick to it.
- Few rules automatically by `LaTeX`.

## Chapters, Headings and Subheadings
First design and then automatically by `LaTeX`. You don't need to do anymore.

- Avoid chapter headings longer than one line.
- If it is necessary to continue any heading on the next line do not divide the word at the end of the first line with a hyphen.
- There is no full stop (dau cham cau) at the end of headings.

## Paragraphs
- Avoid writing very long (a page of text) or very short (3-4 lines) paragraphs.
- Never allow the first line of a new paragraph to stand alone at the bottom of a page, or the last line to stand alone at the top of a page. (Automatically by `LaTeX`)

## Headers and Footers
Provide information to the reader, such as the page number, the title of publication or current chapter or section.

## Lists
First design and then automatically by `LaTeX`.

- Run-in list (separated items by comma)
- Ordered and Unordered
	+ Whole sentence or more than one sentence -> begin with capital letter and end with a full stop.
	+ Sentence fragments do not begin with capital letter and end with a full stop.

## Tables
- Column heading is boldface
- Units (don vi) cua column duoc viet duoi ten column va de trong ngoac, ko in dam
- The first letter of the first word of text is capitalized.
- Text in table columns is written flush left, not right or centered
- Integers are aligned by the right-hand digit, and numbers with decimals should be aligned by the decimal point.
- Columns of numbers with a `+/-` symbol or `<` symbol, etc. are often aligned according to the symbol.
- When referring to specific tables in the text, use *a capital letter*, e.g. “as can be seen in Table 3.1”.

## Figures
Automatically by `LaTeX`

## Equations
- Separated line, normally indented (if there are many or varying length) or centered (if few and short), not set flush left.
- Maybe numbered according to chapter or consecutively. (numbers is placed at the right-hand side of the page).

## Abbreviations, Contractions, Acronyms and Symbols
`Abbreviations should be used for the convenience of the reader, not the writer.` (From the Oxford Guide to Style)

- An `abbreviation` is formed by omitting the end of a word, `e.g. Eq., Fig. and min.`, or by taking the first letter of each word making up a term or phrase, `e.g. VCR, HPLC or MRI`.
- A `contraction` is formed by leaving out the middle of a word, `e.g. expt, Eqn and Mr`
- An `acronym` is formed from the initial letters of a number of words, the result being pronounced as a word, e.g. CERN, SALT and radar. (NB: Some style guides also call combinations of letters that do not form pronounceable words acronyms.)
- `Symbols` are generally one or two letters representing an SI unit or a parameter in an equation.

### Abbreviations and Contractions
- All forms of abbreviations should be explained or defined at their first occurrence in the text. (Abstract is not normally considered part of the text). Abbreviations followed origin words in brackets or conversely.

	`...using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)...`

	`...using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)...`

- One single abbreviation cannot mean different things.
- Be aware of whether your abbreviations pertain to singular or plural forms. For example, define a flexible fuel vehicle as `FFV`, and flexible fuel vehicles automatically become `FFVs`
- Lower-case abbreviations (e.g., i.e., etc.) cannot be used at the beginning of a sentence; write out the full word or expression, or rephrase the sentence.
- The choice of `a` or `an` before an abbreviation depends on how it is pronounced, not the spelling.
	`a BA degree` `a KLM flight` `a UNICEF card` `an MP` `an MA` `an MRI measurement`
- e.g., i.e., etc., et al. and c.
	+ `e.g.`*(exemlpi gratia)*: for example
	+ `i.e.`*(id est)*: that is (nghia la, tuc la)
	+ `etc.`*(et cetera)*: so on, and other things
	+ `et al.`: and others (va nhung nguoi khac)
	+ `*c.*`*(circa)*: meaning "about" (italic form)

### Acronyms
Acronyms differ from abbreviations in that they form pronounceable words. According to this definition, NATO and UEFA are acronyms, but not MRI or HPLC.

### Symbols
- Do not start a sentence with a symbol; spell out the word or expression, or rephrase the sentence.
- Symbols should not be used in running text in the same way as abbreviations. Avoid writing: "...and C was 71.8..." but say instead: "...the value of C was 71.8..." or "...the value of the constant, C, was 71.8..."

## Mathematical signs
Use a special editor for a complicated formula. (LaTeX have math packages)

## Capital Letters
Apart from being used at the beginning of a sentence, capital letters are used in running text to denote places, organizations, people and other proper nouns.
### Places

### Organizations

### People

## Punctuation
### The apostrophe

### Commas and Brackets
- `Commas` are used to denote a pause in a sentence or to separate main clauses from subordinate clauses. Commas are also used to separate items in a list. A pair of commas can also be used to include extra information in a sentence.
- `Brackets` can be used in much the same way as commas(if you prefer them) to include something interesting.

### Colons and Semicolons
- `Colon` is used to introduce the part of the sentence that exemplifies, restates, elaborates or explains the preceding part
- `Semicolons` are used to join together related sentences.

### Hyphens and Dashes
#### Hyphens
- A `hyphen` is a short symbol (-) used to join words together to form compound words, or to divide them at the end of line.
- Very many rules in English :(

#### Dashes
- There are actually two kinds of dashes; one called an `en rule` or `en dash`, and the other an `em rule` or `em dash`. An en rule takes its name from the width of the letter `n` in the text (–), and an em rule the width of the letter `m` (—).

## Numbers and their Units
