# Fundamentals of Effective Writings

## An Introduction to Writing

### What?

Writing consists basically of making a point and then providing evidence
to support or develop that point.
+ What is your point?
+ What is your support for that point?

Four basic principles:
1. **Unity**: start with a clearly stated point.
2. **Support**: provide logical, detailed support for your point.
3. **Coherence**: organize and connect your supporting material.
4. **Sentence Skills**: revise and edit so that your sentences are
   effective and error-free.

### Why?

Benefits of Paragraph Writing
- Mastering the structure of paragraphs will make me a better writer.
- Writing paragraphs strengthens my skills as a reader and listener.
  I'll become more aware of the ideas of other writers and speakers and
  the evidence they provide - or fail to provide - to support those
  ideas.
- Paragraph writing will make me a stronger thinker. Traditional
  paragraph writing will train my mind to think clearly.

When I write for others, it is crucial to know both my purpose for
writing and the audience who will be reading my work.
- Purpose (Why?)
    + To **inform**: to give information about a subject. Authors
      writing to inform want to provide facts that will explain or teach
      something to readers. For example, an informative paragraph about
      sandwiches might begin, "Eating food between two slices of bread -
      a sandwich - is a practice that has its origins in eighteenth-
      century England."
        * To describe
            - Describe the physical appearance and body language of a
              trial witness
        * To explain (process)
            - Explain how to change the ink in a printer.
    + To **persuade**: to convince the reader to agree with the author's
      point of view on a subject. Authors writing to persuade may give
      facts, but their main goal is to argue or prove a point to
      readers. A persuasive paragraph about sandwiches might begin,
      "There are good reasons why every sandwich should be made with
      whole grain bread."
    + To **entertain**: to amuse and delight; to appeal to the reader's
      senses and imagination. Authors write to entertain in various
      ways, through fiction and nonfiction. An entertaining paragraph
      about sandwiches might begin, "What I wanted was a midnight snack,
      but what I got was better - the biggest, most magical sandwich in
      the entire world."
        * Create a story that conveys an important theme about
          environmental conservation.
- Audience (Who?)
    + Is the audience an individual or a group? Is the group specific or
      general?
    + What are the demographic features (age, gender, socioeconomic
      status, religion, politics, education, etc.) of the audience?
    + Why might the reader need or want to read this material?
    + How much does the audience already know about the subject?
    (required knowledge)
        * If I assume that my readers know very little, I might bore
          them with too much basic information. But, if I assume that
          they know more than they do, you might confuse them by using
          unfamiliar technical terminology or neglecting to provide
          enough informative detail.
    + Is my purpose simply to inform the audience? Or is it to convince
      readers of something as well?
    + What type of language should be used? relaxed, friendly, and
      informal or more formal.

### How?

Writing as a skill, competent writing comes only from plain hard work -
determination and sweat.

Writing as a process of discovery
- As you write, you may suddenly switch direction or double back.
- Writers frequently do not know their exact destination as they begin
  to write.

Keeping a daily or almost daily Journal
- Writing a journal will help me develop the habit of thinking on paper
  and will show me how ideas can be discovered in the process of writing
- A journal can make writing a familiar part of my life and can serve as
  a continuing source of ideas for papers.

[How to write an Essay][how-to-write-an-essay]

### Goals

1. If you make one point and stick to that point, your writing will have
   unity.
2. If you back up the point with specific evidence, your writing will
   have support.
3. If you organize and connect the specific evidence, your writing will
   have coherence.
4. If you write clear, error-free sentences, your writing will
   demonstrate effective sentence skills.

### Process

1. Discovering a point - often through prewriting.
2. Developing solid support for the point - often through more
   prewriting.
3. organizing the supporting material and writing it out in a first
   draft.
4. Revising and then editing carefully to ensure an effective, error-
   free paper.


### Prewriting

#### Freewriting

You write on your topic for ten minutes.
- Do not worry about spelling or punctuating correctly, about erasing
  mistakes, about organizing material, or about finding exact words.
- You just write without stopping. If you get stuck for words, you write
  "I am looking for something to say" or repeat words until you think of
  something.

#### Questioning

You generate ideas and details by asking as many questions as you can
think of about your subject. Such question include Why? When? Where?
Who? How? In what ways?

#### Clustering

Clustering, also known as diagramming or mapping. Using lines, boxes,
arrows, and circles to show relationships among the ideas and details.

### Scratch Outline

Point(Topic Sentence): ...
Supports(Statement Sentences):
Statement Sentence 1.
    Concrete Detail 1.
    Commentary 1. (your intellectual comments)
SS2.
    CD2.
    CM2.
SS3.
    CD3.
    CM3.

### Writing a First Draft

- Follow you scratch outline.
- Do not worry yet about grammar, punctuation, or spelling.
- New details and ideas may pop into you mind, just add the new
  information.

### Revising

Rewrite your paragraph, building upon what has already been done, in
order to make it stronger.
- First: set your first draft aside for a while. You can then come back
  to it with a fresher, more objective point of view.
- Second: work with printed, double-spaced text.
- Third: read your draft aloud
- Four: write additional thoughts and changes above the lines or in the
  margins of your paragraph.

#### Revising Content

1. Is my paragraph **unified**?
2. Is my paragraph **supported**?
3. Is my paragraph **organized**?
    - Do I use transitions and other connecting words?

#### Revising Sentences

1. Do I use **parallelism** to balance my words and ideas?
2. Do I have a **consistent point of view**?
3. Do I use **specific** words?
4. Do I use **active** verbs?
5. Do I use words effectively by **avoiding slang, cliches, pretentious
   language**, and **wordiness**?
6. Do I **vary my sentences** in length and structure?

### Editing

Checking a paragraph for mistakes in grammar, punctuation, usage, and
spelling.

### Using Peer Review

- Read partner's paragraph aloud.
- Check or circle the trouble spots.
- Make a scratch outline.

## Point and Supporting the point

### Begin with a point


### Support the point with specific evidence


## Writing in the Digital Age

- Each file contain all stages of the writing process:
    + Prewriting: dim the screen of the monitor so that you can't see
      what you're typing. You won't have to worry about grammar or
      spelling or typing errors; instead, you can concentrate on getting
      down as many ideas and details possible about your subject.
    + Scratch Outline: at any point in the prewriting, outlining you
      might want to do some Google searches to get ideas.
    + First Draft
    + Revising
    + Editing and proofreading

Turn off any notification and turn on the full screen mode when writing.

The Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C., has copies of all books
published in the United States. You can visit at [www.loc.gov][1]

### Evaluating Internet Sources

- Author
    + What credentials does the author have?
    + What academic degrees does he or she hold?
    + Does the author work for a college, university, well-respected
      think tank, or research group?
    + Has he or she published other material on the topic?
- Internal evidence
    + Does the author seem to proceed objectively - presenting all sides
      of the issue fairly before stating his or her own views?
    + Does the **sponsor** of the Web site seem to be an objective
      source?
    + Does the author provide adequate support for his or her views?
    + Was the article first published in a print version?
- Date
    + Is the information up to date?

# Essay development

## How to write the introduction

### Thesis Statement

- https://www.kibin.com/essay-writing-blog/thesis-statement-examples/

- Topic: debatable
- Position (Stance): agree/disagree
- Reason/Evidence (3 points)

## How to write the conclusion

[Strategies for Writing a Conclusion][strategies-for-writing-a-conclusion]

A writer needs to keep in mind that the conclusion is often what a
reader remembers best. Your conclusion should be the best part of your
paper.

### A conclusion should

- stress the important of the thesis statement,
- give the essay a sense of completeness, and
- leave a final impression on the reader.

### The way to get the ideas

- Answer the question "So What?"
    + Show your readers why this paper was important. Show them that
      your paper was meaningful and useful.
- Synthesize, don't summarize
    + Don't simply repeat things that were in your paper. They have read
    it. Show them how the points you made and the support and examples
    you used were not random, but fit together.
- Redirect your readers
    + Give your reader something to think about, perhaps a way to use
    your paper in the "real" world. Think globally.
- Create a new meaning
    + You don't have to give new information to create a new meaning. By
    demonstrating how your ideas work together, you can create a new
    picture.

### Strategies

#### Echoing the introduction

#### Challenging the reader

#### Looking to the future

#### Posing questions

# [Plagiarism][plagiarism]

Plagiarism

# Write an email - email etiquette

## Format

- Greeting
- Who you are?
- Your reason for writing
- Closing
- Signature

## Rules

### Greeting

- Starting email with: `Dear`, `Hello`, `Hi`
- Using first name in regular workplace, some upper-level prefer `Mr.`
  or `Ms.`, using `Dr.` for a medical doctor or professor for the first
  time. If you don't have a specific name for the recipient, a simple
  `Hello` is perfectly sufficient.
- If you do not know the recipient's gender, you should use
    + `Dear FirstName LastName`

### Closing

- `Best`: easy to use
- `Best regards`: This phrase is professional, but with some warmth.
  It's common for business emails that are less formal, such as between
  co-workers who work together somewhat frequently. This can be
  shortened further to `Regards` when emailing someone familiar.
- `Sincerely`: This is a universal closing sentiment and appropriate in
  most situations, little bit old-fashion.
- `Thanks`, `Thanks so much`, `Many thanks`: more familiar
- `Thank you`, `Thank you so much`: more formal
- `Respectfully`: This is a formal sendoff that's appropriate when
  emailing the CEO, Chairman of the Board, or a high-level company
  executive.
- `Fondly`: This is definitely a social closing, not a professional one,
  a level of familiarity.
- `Warm regards`: This is a more formal version of `fondly`, but it's
  still best suited for social emails.
- `Hope this helps`

### Signature

Make sure your signature line lists the basics: your full name, title,
company name, and contact information, including phone numbers and
email.

## Write an email to a professor for a recommendation

[How](http://www.wikihow.com/Email-a-Professor)

### Example

```
Dear Professor XXX,

I am a student at XXX College with a major in xxx.  I am a junior and
will be graduating next May.  I have a 4.0 GPA and experience in our
college’s summer program in xxx.

I am planning to attend graduate school in xxx, with a focus on xxx.  In
one of my classes, “xxx,” which was taught by Professor XXX, I had the
chance to read your article, “xxxx.”  I really enjoyed it, and it gave
me many ideas for my future research.  I have been exploring graduate
programs where I can work on this topic.

I hope you don’t mind my getting in touch, but I’d like to inquire
whether you are currently accepting graduate students.  And if you are,
if you’d be willing to talk to me a bit more, by email or on the phone,
or in person if I can arrange a campus visit, about my graduate school
plans.  I have explored your department’s graduate school website in
detail, and it seems like an excellent fit for me because of its
emphasis on xx and xx,  but I still have a few specific questions about
xx and xxx that I’d like to talk to you about.

I know you’re very busy so I appreciate any time you can give me.
Thanks very much,

Sincerely,

XX XXX

Dear Professor Kirby,

I want to thank you for agreeing to write me a letter of recommendation.

The scholarship which I am applying is the undergraduate transfer
scholarship of Jack Kent Cooke Foundation, and the scholarship will due
on October 24, 2017. In the application process, they will send an email
with a recommendation form to your email, and you can write the letter
of recommendation on that form.

The website of the scholarship program is:
http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/undergraduate-transfer/

Some selection criteria for the scholarship are:
- Achievement and academic ability
- Financial need
- Persistence
- Services to other
- Leadership

I hope maybe you can include my academic ability, financial need, and
other aspects corresponding to the selection criteria in your
recommendation because those are qualities the selection committee wants
to see. In this email, I attached a document file which contains all my
background information that relates to those criteria. Please let me
know if you need any further information.

I also want to extend an additional thank you for the time I spent under
your instruction. I really enjoyed your course, and I cannot express how
much I have taken away from Calculus 1. It helped me developed my
interest in Mathematics. Thank you very much!

Sincerely,

Son Tran

Dr. XXXXXX,

I hope your summer is off to a good start. This is just a brief reminder
that the Pre-medical Committee office asks that letters of
recommendation for medical school applicants be submitted as close to
June 1 as possible. The application verification process began today and
AMCAS will begin sending information to individual schools within a
couple of weeks. It is best if all of my letters are included in this
initial submission, as that will minimize delays in the review process.

If you need another copy of my personal statement or other pertinent
documents I would be happy to send them to you.

Once again, thank you so much for your help and support. It truly means
a great deal to me. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for
you.

Dear Professor Jones,

Thank you so much for taking the time from your busy schedule to write a
letter of recommendation for my graduate school application. I know that
it will be helpful in my endeavor to become a student at Harvard.

I can honestly say that you are one of the best teachers I have had in
16 years of schooling. I remember your lecture on the apparent motion of
satellites over the surface of the Earth. In one instant, I suddenly
understood what was bothering me for years -- Why do satellites and
spacecraft follow those crazy wavy patterns over the equator? Your
insight and your careful, thoughtful explanation made a complex subject
easy to understand. I looked forward to attending your class each week.

Once again, thank you for your time. I wish you the very best in the

Thank you for taking the time to write me a letter of recommendation. I
could not have asked for nicer comments. Your letter paved the way for
numerous interviews and a job offer from Doe Corporation, where I wanted

significant impact on my life for years to come. I hope I can
reciprocate the favor.

As you know, I've been in the process of applying for various employment
opportunities over the past weeks. Recently, I received a very desirable
offer to fill a position at an energetic and exciting company. Although
both a resume exhibiting experiences and credentials suited to the job
and a successful interview certainly contributed to my success, I feel
that your willingness to speak as a professional reference on my behalf
played a central role in the company's decision to offer me the
position.

I am writing to express my gratitude for your time and consideration in
support of my endeavors. Your perspective and encouragement mean a great
deal to me. Thank you for all that you've done.

Thank you for your kindness in agreeing to write a letter of
recommendation to accompany my application to medical school. I have
wanted to study medicine since my biology class in the eighth grade, and
have selected extracurricular activities that would be consistent with
that goal. My university grades are good, and I have been a volunteer at
the local hospital for the past year. I will soon have a preliminary
interview with a selections committee, but before that interview I need
to secure letters of recommendation.

The admissions committee informs successful candidates approximately
four months after the submission deadline. I will inform you of the
results as soon as I receive them.

I know it takes a lot of time to write a letter of recommendation, and I
deeply appreciate your kindness. I will do my best to deserve your
confidence. Thank you very much.

Without your recommendation, I do not feel that my application would
have made the same impact. You are a pillar in the community and highly
respected by everyone.

Thank you once again for your powerful, well-thought-out recommendation.
It means a lot that you would take time out of your busy schedule to
help me succeed. If I can be of any service to you in the future, please

Dear [Name],

I want to thank you for taking the time out of your (undoubtedly) busy
schedule to write a letter of recommendation for me. The letter seems to
have been very well received as I have already been offered positions at
several companies that were very high on my wish list.

You've been so kind to me. I know it is your job to teach and guide our
young minds, but I've yet to encounter a professor who works as hard to
make a positive impact on the lives of his students. You give the
profession a good name, and I consider myself very lucky to have been a
part of your class room.

I plan to have all the interviews before making the final decision on
where I decide to work. Luckily, you've already given me so much good
advice, I know that Iâ€™ll make the right choice.

It has been an unparalleled pleasure and honor having you as my teacher
and mentor. I treasure all the knowledge and wisdom you have shared with
me and I truly appreciate the time, effort and sincerity you have
devoted in writing a letter on my behalf.

I will keep you posted about my progress, and where I eventually decide
to work. In the mean time, please let me know if there is anything I can
do to help you out with your courses. I'll still be in the Boston area
for at least the rest of the fall, and I'd love to help you out in some
way if possible.

# Personal Statement

## Scholarship

> Think of the personal statement as an "intellectual autobiography."
The statement should convey to your readers a clear, thoughtful picture
or impression of you as a person who has distinct interests,
motivations, accomplishments, aims and ideas.

### Do

- Be absolutely honest: do not try to lie or make up things
- Be yourself to be unique: write from your heart and emotions
- Make it interesting, concrete, and specific
    + Using detail and specific examples to prove your points
    + Using specific names, references and illustrations
    + Find the "story" in your history: your life has been a journey,
      with planned and unexpected turns, with successful and frustrated
      goals, with hard-earned and accidental insights, with hoped-for
      but as-yet-unrealized achievements. Tell the story that makes
      sense of your life as it has been, is, and could be.
    + Be realistic but bold: understand your strength, weaknesses, and
      passion. Write to engage your reader, write in a way that invites
      him or her to want to meet and get to know you.
- Read the questions or requirements carefully to define a central idea,
  impression or theme you hope to convey. Common questions are:
    + Why did you choose to attend college?
    + What are skills you have gained and things you have learned about
      yourself through your academic and life experiences?
    + What are your future educational or career plans?
    + What do you hope to learn and experience in the future?

### Don't

- Write to impress. Use your personal statement to talk to your readers
  about the things that motivate, inspire and shape you. Help them to
  understand what your specific accomplishments have meant to you, or
  how they have shaped you. Help them to understand why  you care about
  the things you care about.
- Write in cliches. Ask yourself if each sentence in your draft reflects
  some thought, fact, reflection or experience of your own. Avoid
  sentences that could have been written by absolutely anyone. Avoid
  stock phrases or expressions.
- Re-write your resume
- Be too general or abstract

### Steps

#### 1. Develop a rough draft to use as an outline

Create an outline of achievements and experiences that you will include
in your essay. Consider a way to logically group some ideas together
into one section/category. Some topics:
- Scholarships and awards and leadership roles
- School and community involvement with an emphasis on active
  contributions to any club, association, or civic organization
- Skills and special knowledge, special projects, research in your area
  of study (including teaching and tutoring)
- Life and educational experiences that have motivated you or have
  demonstrated your ability to overcome obstacles and challenges
  successfully in order to continue your education.
- Academic and career goals
- Address your personal financial circumstances, including any unusual
  or extenuating circumstances, and why you are a worthy candidate for
  scholarship consideration.

#### 2. Start with a strong thesis or umbrella statement outlining your goals, and indicating the main categories you will be discussing in your essay

Example: My academic achievements, my work experience, and my community
service have all helped me to work toward my goals.

Be sure that each of your paragraphs begin with a clear topic sentence
which indicates which topics your are focusing on in that paragraph.

- Example: My volunteer experiences helped me choose the right career
  plan for me.
- Example: I have developed strong leadership skills, and have learned
  to interact with a wide variety of people while working several
  different jobs.
- Example: Although I have faced many obstacles in my life, I am fully
  motivated to reach my career goal of being a psychologist.

#### 3. You must stress how your experience helped you to develop the kinds of skills and qualities that selection committees are looking for in a good candidate.

These include the following qualities:
- Scholarship, knowledge of chosen field, carefulness of work
- Motivation, enthusiasm, seriousness of purpose
- Creativity, originality, ingenuity in problem-solving
- Ability to plan and carry out research, organization
- Ability to express thought in speech and writing
- Maturity, emotional stability, ability to withstand stress and face
  challenges
- Self-reliance, initiative, independence, adaptability
- Responsibility, ability to make sound judgments
- Effectiveness with people, tact, ability to work with others,
  communicate effectively
- Community service, volunteerism

#### 4. Stress a constant theme: that many of your past experiences have helped to prepare you to be a good candidate for the scholarship

#### 5. Choice of words is important

Use words like "good candidate," "well-prepared," "good leaderships
skills" and other terms that remain modest while demonstrating your
abilities.

Avoid exaggerated terms like "fantastic background,"  "my eternal
passion for learning," "my exceptiona skills," "my outstanding
leadership ability." Instead, let the evidence speak for itself.

#### 6. Have someone else read over your essay to make sure that you have not made any exaggerated claims

### Samples

```
My life has been a struggle at times, but my hard work, determination,
and enthusiasm for my education and my community has brought to UM Flint
where I can pursue my dreams.

My academic plans are to major in pre-med and minor in chemistry. After
graduating, I plan to obtain a nursing license. During my career as a
nurse, I will attend medical school at the University of Michigan,
studying forensic pathology. After medical school, I will do two years
of residency to gain experience to complete my studies and training for
my chosen field, a forensic nurse.

I’m a hardworking-dedicated student, who focuses on my studies, yet I
have always enjoyed being involved in extracurricular activities. While
in high school, I was captain of the varsity volleyball team for two
years. I was also elected president of my class. I attended the Genesee
Area Skill Center where I studied forensic science and was a member of
the Technical Honor Society and HOSA (Health Occupation Student
Association). I am currently involved in a scholarship program called
CEO (Committed to Excellence and Opportunity) here at UM Flint. Next
year, I plan to get more involved in college activities. I am interested
in joining the student government club and a sorority. I am also active
in my community. I volunteer at numerous places like the Humane Society
and the North End Soup Kitchen.

I am the oldest of four children being raised by a single parent. My
mother, Charlene Jackson, is a hardworking woman who struggles to keep
food on the table; I work two jobs to help support my family, but we
barely scrape by. Sometimes even getting transportation to school is a
struggle for me. Because my mom is endeavoring through these hard times,
I try my best to keep my grades up, knowing that I have opportunities
that my mother never had.

# Statement of Purpose

| Statement of Purpose                                                                                      | Personal Statement                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -                                                                                                         | -                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| It has a sharper focus. It should show that you have a strong sense of purpose in applying to the program | It gives you more freedom than a statement of purpose (both skills and character)                                                                                                                     |
| Why do you want to pursue the program? What are your relevant qualifications/experiences/current work?    | What drives your? What makes you stand out from others? Extenuating circumstances, personal challenges (e.g. financial hardship, disabilities) overcome, or just a discussion of what makes them tick |

You may want to write about experiences directly related to the graduate
program and go into detail about why you are choosing a specific
program.
- Other factors like location of the school or internship opportunities
- Information about particular classes, GPA, academic and professional
  achievements
- Professors whose work you admire or whose work aligns with your own
  research goals
- Your short and long term goals
- Avoid writing about anything not directly related to the program.
    + For example, if you are applying to a program i Materials Science,
      don't start the essay with an anecdote about running a marathon or
      spend a paragraph writing about your experience volunteering at a
      homeless shelter.

# Acknowledgement

```
My internship would not have been possible without the generous support
of my mentor John Doe, and other members of CEP group. I am grateful
to all of those I have had the pleasure to work with during this
internship. Each of the members of the CEP team has provided me
extensive personal and professional guidance and taught me a great deal
about both technical skills and life in general. I would especially like
to thank John Doe. As my mentor, he has taught me more than I could
give him credit for here. He has shown me, by his example, what a hard
working person should be.
