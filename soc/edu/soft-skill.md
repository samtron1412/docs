# Overview

Soft skills are also known as Interpersonal skills or people skills. These are skills such as integrity, communication, optimism, business etiquette, flexibility and being a team player.

Technical skills (hard skills) and job-related skills are a must, but people who rank high with good soft skills, are generally the people that most employers want to hire, retain and promote.

# 1. Communication

- Actually paying attention to listen to the speaker
    + Don't multitask

    + Don't pontificate (express one's opinions in a way considered
      annoyingly pompous and dogmatic.)

          pushback
        * setting aside of oneself, personal opinions
    + Use open-ended questions: who, why, when, where, how

      with an exciting idea
