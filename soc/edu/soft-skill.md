# Overview
Soft skills are also known as Interpersonal skills or people skills. These are skills such as integrity, communication, optimism, business etiquette, flexibility and being a team player.

Technical skills (hard skills) and job-related skills are a must, but people who rank high with good soft skills, are generally the people that most employers want to hire, retain and promote.
