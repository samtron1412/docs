### Identifying an Educational Goal
You can always change your goal as you learn more about yourself and more about your interests and ambitions. The faster you identify your goals, the more quickly the college can help you get on your way toward achieving your dreams.

| Your possible goal       | What does it mean?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Associate's Degree**   | An associate's degree is an `undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, and/or technical colleges`. Some people consider an associate's degree a `"two-year" degree`, though it may longer time than that to complete a course of study to prepare for a job or to reach another educational goal. You may also, however, be seeking an associate's degree with an intent to transfer to a university. If so, please read the description provided about a university transfer pathway.                                                                                                                                             |
| **University Transfer**  | A university transfer pathway is designed to help students complete all of their major requirements for their `first two years of college study`; however, completing these requirements may take more than two years depending on your assessment results and on your program of study. You will be able to complete your major preparation at the community college. With an associate's degree for transfer, you will be assured better transfer opportunities to the California State University system. To learn more about the degree with a guarantee, go to this [link](http://californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/Students/AssociateDegreeforTransfer.aspx) |
| **Occupational Certificate** | The occupational or career education certificate is `a sequence of courses leading to a specific area of emphasis for the purposes of employment`. It is designed for those students `who have limited time to pursue their formal education and who wish to specialize in a particular employment-related area`. Certificates may be completed in a few semesters, or a couple of years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Job Skills**               | Students seeking job skills are generally just looking to take a few courses `to get better at something they already know` how to do or develop a new skill that they can apply right away in a job situation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Career Exploration**       | Students seeking career exploration are looking to take courses in some specific areas in order to determine if they would like to pursue a career in one of those fields. Students who start college with a career exploration goal may change their aspirations to a degree, certificate, or transfer pathway.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Fundamental Skills**       | Students who want to pursue fundamental skills are seeking courses to improve areas such as `reading, mathematics, writing, or English as a Second Language (ESL)`. Improvement in these areas may help them improve other aspects of their lives. Pursuing the improvement of fundamental skills may lead to the development of other goals like a degree, certificate, or transfer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

[The BOGFW application](http://home.cccapply.org/money/bog-fee-waiver).

### How do I know if I am eligible for financial aid ?
First, there are basic requirements that do not relate to your financial need. To be eligible for most financial aid you must:
- Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen [see the **Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)** for more detail].
- Be registered with **Selective Service** / Military (if required).
- Be working toward a degree, certificate or eligible goal (such as transfer).
- Not owe a refund on a federal grant or be in default on a federal educational loan.
- Be a high school graduate or have the equivalent of a high school diploma (like a GED), or in some cases for students enrolled before July 2012, who have taken a test.
- Not have been convicted of drug possession or sales in the recent past (see the FAFSA for more detail).

Second, your **family income, assets, and other financial factors** are reviewed to see if you could be financially eligible to receive aid.

Third, the aid you may be offered depends on when you apply, when you respond to requests from the Financial Aid Office, and any types of special eligibility you may demonstrate.

Finally, to continue receiving your financial aid, you must make progress towards your educational objectives while you are in college. You may view the satisfactory academic standards for financial aid at http://www.cccd.edu/students/financial-aid/Pages/Satisfactory-Academic-Progress-Policy.aspx

### Where I do start ?
Once you have **all of your documentation**, you will need to **complete FAFSA**, which will help you to know what grants and loans may be available to you to cover tuition and life expenses while you are a student.

[FAFSA form](https://fafsa.ed.gov/fotw1516/pdf/fafsaws15c.pdf)

`Progress Probation`

A student who **has attempted at least 12 semester units** in the Coast Colleges and **the percentage of units per semester or overall in which entries of "W", "I" and "NP" are recorded reaches or exceeds 50 percent**. All probationary students shall be notified of their status and counseling services will be made available.

### 2. What is Disqualification?
A student in the Coast Colleges who is on academic and/or progress probation shall be disqualified whenever he or she meets one or both of the two conditions listed below:

`Academic Disqualification`

Any student on **academic probation for two consecutive semesters** shall be academically disqualified.

`Progress Disqualification`

Any student who is on **progress probation for two consecutive semesters** shall be disqualified for lack of satisfactory progress.

Students on *Academic and/or Progress Disqualification for the first time* are **required to complete the Online Disqualification Workshop and will be restricted to 7 units**. You are also encouraged to **meet with a counselor** to discuss strategies for improving student success.

Students on *Academic and/or Progress Disqualification a second time* are required to sit out the subsequent semester, but can return following their sit out. Upon return students are required to complete the Online Disqualification Workshop and will be restricted to 7 units.

### 3. What is Course Repetition?
If you earn a **D** or **F** grade in a course you may repeat the exact same course to improve your grade.

Once the course is repeated your GPA will automatically be recalculated and the previous grade will be disregarded in the calculation of your GPA.  The grade(s) in the **latest term will be the grade(s) which will be used to calculate grade point average** regardless of which grade was higher.

Although the previous grade(s) will not be counted in the grade point average, they will remain visible on the transcript and the last recorded attempt is the course which will be counted in your permanent academic history.

**Three is the maximum number of times** you may attempt the same course, whether you receive a D, F, W or NP.

`You may not repeat a course in which you receive a C or better.`

[Golden West Course Repetition](http://www.goldenwestcollege.edu/admissions/repetition.html)

### 4. What is Academic Renewal?

If you earn a 2.00 or below semester GPA but it doesn't make sense for you to repeat the course(s) because **the course(s) do not apply to your educational goals**, you may be eligible for Academic Renewal.  A maximum of 2 semesters or a maximum of  30 semester units of coursework at Coast Community College District which have been properly petitioned may be alleviated or disregarded when we compute your cumulative grade point averages.

### Taking Required tests
#### Test for Undergraduate programs
Most **colleges** require you to take one of the most common tests, the SAT or the ACT.

Most **community colleges** have open enrollment and don't require standardized test scores. However, they will usually require placement tests. Later, if you transfer from a community college to a university or another school, test scores *may be* required.

##### SAT
The SAT measures your **ability rather than knowledge**. The 3 3/4 hour test contains three sections: **writing, critical reading, and math**. Most of the question are multiple-choice.

Some colleges may also require you to take an SAT Subject Test. **SAT Subject Tests measure your knowledge in specific subjects** within five general categories: English, mathematics, history, science, and languages.

[link](http://sat.collegeboard.org/home)

##### ACT
The ACT measure what you've learned in school.

The ACT consists of four multiple-choice tests: English, reading, mathematics, and science. If your college requires a writing test, you can take the ACT Plus Writing, which includes a writing test in addition to the other four tests.

[link](http://www.act.org/)

#### Tests for Graduate Programs
##### Graduate Record Examinations (GRE)
- The GRE General Test measures your **verbal**, **quantitative** (mathematical), and **analytical writing** skills. The test runs approximately *three hours*.
- GRE Subject Tests measure **your knowledge in specific subject** areas. You usually take a Subject Test related to you undergraduate major. The tests usually take **3 1/2 hours**.

### Applying to Schools
- Narrow your application choices
- Research Admission requirements carefully
- Create a check list
- Apply early

- Submit one application for many schools. [The common application](http://www.commonapp.org/)

### Learning about budgeting
While you're in college or career school, you'll need to learn how to manage your finances, plan for changes, and prepare for the unexpected. Budgeting will help you build decision-making skills and reach your financial and academic goals. Budgeting keeps your finances under control.
