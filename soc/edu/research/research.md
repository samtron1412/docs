# General Skills Obtained through Research

- Working on open-ended projects (vs. most course-work)
    - intuition for when an approach is reaching its limitations, a
    direction is a dead-end, versus will just require more work to get
    there
- ability to pick up new advanced concepts
- ability to decide what problems are worth working on
    + what are its impacts?
- Research process
    + identify limitations of current approaches
    + come up with an idea to address a limitation
        * studying existing tools
        * from problems you really want to solve
    + no tractable solution in generality
        * think about regimes in which a technique might excel
            - the domain my idea is good
        * experiment with illustrative examples
        * benchmark
    + if successful, write paper, otherwise try again
- Why is real undergraduate research involvement so challenging?
    + math
    + tools

    one and things fall into places => take time
- How to be productive/successful?
    + keep healthy
    + working hard
    + foundation: ee263, cs229, ee364a, cs287

        probably won't even realize when you are
    + looking up tips
        * how to be a good PhD student (in CS/AI/Robotics)?
        * how to read a paper?
        * how to write a paper? (Jennifer Widom! - Stanford)

        * graduate students
    + beehive
    + sense of inititive (try things)
    + I don't know how to connect with you. Sending email or office
    hours, how can I connect with you. I interested in doing research
    robotics and AI. What your criteria, or requirements to do research
    in your areas?
    + I studied this and this on my own, I think it is a good fit for
    the project
    + asking professors or graduate students
- something that I want to add on is

## Pister's guidelines

----------------------------------------------------------------
Collaboration, sharing ideas, etc.

Talk about your ideas.  Help your colleagues work out their problems.
Pay attention to what other people are doing, and see if you can learn
something, or if you can contribute.

Other than the mundane goal of getting your PhD ;), you are in
graduate school to push back the frontiers of knowledge.  You do this
by generating and exploring new ideas.  There is no way that you will
ever be able to explore all of the ideas that you generate, but some
of those ideas that you discard might be just what some of your
colleagues are looking for.

Human nature tends to make us want to hoard our own ideas.  You have
to fight against that.  Human nature also tends to make us treat other
people's ideas with disrespect.  The closer the idea to our own area
of research, the more likely some part of our brain will try to find
fault with it.  Fight against that even harder.

You will find many people in academia who give in to the dark side.
These Stealth Researchers never discuss what they are working on,
except in vague and deceptive terms.  They are experts at finding
fault with the work of their colleagues.  The Stealth Researcher
writes papers that make very grand claims, but you can never quite
figure out what they've accomplished and what they haven't.  He is a
master at omitting the key detail of the design or process that would
enable others to follow his work.  The Stealth Researcher is a
knowledge diode, a roach motel for information.  He has replaced the
fundamental goal of discovery and publication with the twin evils of
ego and empire.

Be open about what you are working on.  Be honest about what you've
done, and even more honest about what you haven't.  Don't ever hide an
idea for fear that someone will steal it, even if you are talking to a
Stealth Researcher.  With patience, maybe we can cure them.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Purchasing Equipment and Supplies

In general: Buy it!

Many graduate students have a hard time adjusting to the idea of
spending thousands of dollars on equipment that they may only need
for one measurement.  The reality is that equipment is one of the
most important assets that a lab can have.  The more stuff we've
got lying around, the more likely we can do experiments the right
way, and do them quickly.

So buy it!

Funding a graduate student full-time for a year costs about 40,000
dollars (I realize that you don't see much of that, unfortunately).
From a bean-counting point of view, if you spend a few thousand dollars
each month buying equipment that doubles your productivity or rate of
progress, it's a big win.  Worse, students often waste months or even
years of their graduate careers making lousy measurements with lousy
equipment.  Advisors only have a certain amount of time that they can
spend with students, which limits the number of students we can have.
If the students waste their time with lousy equipment, everyone loses.

So buy it!

----------------------------------------------------------------
Publication

A research university exists to train students and to discover and
disseminate.  Traditionally dissemination has taken the form of
publication (although the web is changing that somewhat, or at least
changing the definition of publication).

Conference publication serves to expose a particular research
community to your ideas and results.  A few hundred people will see
your paper within the first few months of its appearance.  Very few
copies of the conference proceedings will exist after a decade has
passed.

MEMS conferences tend to have pretty fast turnaround.  You submit an
extended abstract (typically 1 page of text and 1 or 2 of figures) six
months before the conference.  A couple of months later you find out
if you are accepted.  If accepted, you have another month or two to
write the full/final version of the paper.

Journal publication (sometimes known as archival publication) serves
to preserve your ideas and results indefinitely.  Hundreds or
thousands of libraries will keep copies of your paper for decades.

It's OK to submit a conference paper to a journal (this is common
and encouraged, if it's a good conference paper).

It's OK to submit the same ideas to two different conferences if they
are in two different communities as long as you let both conferences
know that that is what you are planning to do.  If you're working on
the border between two fields (say robotics and MEMS), this may be the
only way to get people in both fields aware of your ideas.

It's NOT ok to submit the same ideas to two conferences in the same
field, although lots of people do this (see LPI, below).

It's absolutely NOT ok to submit the same ideas to two journals, same
field, different field, whatever.  Your ideas should be archived once
only.

LPI vs. innovation
------------------
Many people seem to like to pad their resumes with conference
publications.  This leads to phrases like "least publishable
increment" and "epsilon improvement".  Don't do this.

Reputation
----------
Most academic communities are pretty small, and the people on top
usually have pretty good memories.  As a result, your reputation
is extremely important to your success.

Things to avoid:
 - promising more in the abstract than you deliver in the paper
 - misleading or vague results, descriptions, etc. (Stealth Research)
 - LPI/epsilon publishing

Note that your reputation is intimately tied with the reputation of
your advisor, your colleagues in your group, BSAC, and to some extent
UC Berkeley as a whole.  On the plus side, you get a huge dose of
reputation (most of it good) just by being in BSAC.  On the down side,
if you screw up you put a little tarnish on the reputation of everyone
you work with.

Highest goal
------------
Publish something that other people find so useful that they start
doing it themselves.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Writing conference abstracts

Be absolutely brutally honest.  Describe carefully what you have done,
what you haven't done, and what you expect to do by the conference
date.

Give clear reasons why your work is important
 - best performance so far (cite specific examples)
 - completely new capability
 - completely new idea

The abstract will never be published, so you can afford to be a little
more harsh and forward in your comparisons to other work.  Sadly, this
often makes a big difference in getting accepted.  Don't forget that
some of the people you compare to will be reading the abstract!

----------------------------------------------------------------
Author lists for publications

There are no simple guidelines for who should go on the author list, or
in what order.  If someone is involved in the creation of the ideas that
are in the paper, then they should definitely be on the author list.  If
they helped out with some of the testing, or helped you debug a design,
or edited a version or two of the paper, then they deserve a mention in
the acknowledgements for sure, but not necessarily inclusion in the
author list.  In general, adding another person to the author list doesn't
"cost" you anything in terms of credit, so it's ok to err on the side of
inclusion.

## Journal vs. Conference Papers

- Both conference and journal papers in the top venues
    + conferences: fast cycle, not archived
    + journals: slower cycle, archived

---------- Forwarded message --------- From: BDD Admin
<bdd@berkeley.edu> Date: Thu, Dec 19, 2019 at 5:37 PM Subject: Berkeley
DeepDrive call for fifth-year proposals (two page proposals due Friday,
Jan 31st 9am) To: Cc: Bdd-its Departmental <bdd@berkeley.edu>, Trevor
Darrell <trevor@eecs.berkeley.edu>, Kurt W KEUTZER
<Keutzer@berkeley.edu>, Ching-Yao CHAN <Cychan@berkeley.edu>


Colleagues,

The Berkeley DeepDrive effort is soliciting proposals for new projects
from PIs not currently funded by the Center, as well as requesting new
and continuation funding proposals from current PIs.  The current
projects are visible on BDD’s website.

The scope of projects of interest to our center includes advanced
machine learning for intelligent autonomy, computer vision and
autonomous perception, functionality and applications for automated
driving, advanced robotics and manipulation, as well as data sets to
support scientific studies and engineering developments.

Collaborative proposals by multiple PIs are especially welcome. Even if
the proposal doesn’t engage multiple PIs, showing connections to other
past, present, and future (i.e. other proposals) BDD projects is
encouraged. All proposals are due Friday, January 31st, at 9
a.m. Decisions will be made in April, and the funding awards beginning
in June.

Proposals are selected by the BDD steering committee, based in part on
rankings by sponsor technical leads, who review and score the
intellectual merit and industrial relevance of the effort.  To date, the
collection of BDD sponsors have collectively been interested in a wide
range of theoretical to practical advances at all stages of
maturity. Most of BDD’s industrial affiliates have indicated their
research interests in this document.

PIs have generally been funded to support one to two graduate students
in the first year.  PIs funded under the effort are expected to
contribute the majority of software and data supported by the funds to
the BDD repository, which is released under an academic/non-profit
open-source license to the public, and with a commercial-use
non-exclusive royalty-free license to sponsors and authors. The BDD
license promises both patent and copyright non-exclusive royalty free
use to sponsors, and non-commercial use to all; PIs may simultaneously
release software also under other open source licenses (e.g., BSD) which
provide even broader copyright use, if that is their standard practice.
Funding is unrestricted, and subject only to agreement with the BDD
steering committee. PIs are also expected to participate and give
presentations in review meetings each term, and for them or their
students to be available periodically for virtual or in-person meetings
with sponsors who wish to learn more about the work. Visits to sponsors
are encouraged but not required. Each corporate partner’s first choice
of research proposal will be funded by the Center, and if that is your
proposal, it is expected that you will play a key role in maintaining
BDD’s relationship with that sponsor.

Proposal format and submission is detailed in the following paragraph.

FORMAT & REQUIREMENTS: Two-page proposals and two-page CVs are requested
from PIs.  URLs may be included in each to reference additional
information. PIs should specify the research challenges they plan to
tackle, related prior work, timeline, budget summary, project summary,
relevant data to be collected, and infrastructure they plan to develop
including software they will create and contribute to the BDD Code/ Data
Repository.  Those that have been previously funded by BDD will need to
provide a list of the code and/or data they have contributed to the
repository, and all proposals will need to indicate what they plan to
contribute to the repository this year.

PIs should request an approximate funding level for their effort and
indicate a rough allocation of costs. Projects are expected to be
initially funded at $50K or $100K/yr of direct unrestricted costs. PIs
may propose multiple projects.

Please include at least one high-resolution project photo (may be from
your proposal), the names of the researchers who will work on the
project (if known), and the keywords for the project.

Please note which category or categories your proposal falls under:
advanced machine learning for intelligent autonomy, computer vision and
autonomous perception, functionality and applications for automated
driving, advanced robotics and manipulation, as well as data sets to
support scientific studies and engineering developments.

It is expected that projects will be annually reviewed and renewed based
on available funding, research outcomes, and funding priorities.
Proposals and CVs should be in PDF format. Any UC Berkeley PI may apply.

To submit a proposal please follow the instructions listed below for
creating an EasyChair profile and uploading your proposal.

1. Go to this link:  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bdd2020

2. Create an account if you don't already have one

3.  Once you've created an account using the same link from above,
    https://easychair.org/conferences/conf=bdd2020, to return to the
    correct page: BDD Proposals >My Recent Roles, select Author

4. Follow the rest of the prompts for submitting a proposal

Please forward it to other relevant faculty and PI mailing lists within
UC Berkeley.  Proposals involving funding to non-Berkeley UC PIs or PIs
at other institutions are possible but discouraged.

Joint proposals by PIs to integrate cross-domain research are
encouraged. The funding level will be commensurate with the scope and
expected outcome.

While we expect sponsors to use their best judgment in handling our
proposals and not share them outside of their orgs, BDD does not
consider them proprietary information.   PIs should not put anything
proprietary or non-public in their proposals.

The BDD model is we do not conduct any specific research for any
sponsor, nor provide special access to any project for sponsor(s);
everything we do is shared with all our sponsors equally and generally
published openly at the same time we share with sponsors (just with a
different license.)  Proposals (and the ensuing research) should be
conceived/conducted for the benefit of all sponsors.  It is fine if
there ends up a single sponsor who is the main "champion" for a project
during the funding review, but nonetheless, all sponsors will have equal
access to the results of the project.  If PIs wish to share anything
confidential with a sponsor during their project we can set up a
case-by-case NDA, but this should be rare and not excessively for the
specific benefit of a single sponsor.   We have allowed and will
continue to allow beta-test access to help debug code or datasets prior
to a broad release; this is often at the same time as other academic
collaborators from other universities are allowed beta-test access.  We
can still do this at our discretion, especially if it benefits the
research project to do so, but it is important to know we do not have
any specific obligation to do so.  Feel free to consult us on any
specific cases.
