## Werner Vogels (AWS CTO)

- The Machine Stops by E.M. Forster: Written in 1909, Forster’s
  portrayal of a society that prefers virtual experiences to real-world
  encounters eerily anticipates our current dependency on digital
  connectivity. As our reliance on technology grows, his message about
  isolation and the fragility of these networks seems more urgent than
  ever.
- Player Piano by Kurt Vonnegut: Written in 1952, Player Piano is
  Vonnegut’s first novel, which takes a darkly satirical look at the
  consequences of hyper-automation. As discussions about AI and mass
  displacement heat up, Vonnegut’s cautionary tale about what happens
  when human labor and creativity are sidelined feels alarmingly
  prescient.
- Walkaway by Cory Doctorow: Doctorow envisions a future shaped by
  grassroots innovations, 3D printing, and cooperative governance. His
  vision suggests both the resilience of self-organized communities and
  the fragility of systems trying to maintain control. With
  conversations about decentralized tech on the rise, Walkaway becomes a
  roadmap for alternative social structures.
- Infomacracy by Malka Older: Older envisions a world carved into
  “micro-democracies,” each governed by data-driven elections under the
  watchful eye of a global information network. This premise is
  startlingly relevant to our current discussions about election
  integrity, misinformation, and the role of big tech. It challenges us
  to imagine whether more localized, data-centric politics could create
  a fairer system or simply magnify the existing faults
- Expert Political Judgement: How Good Is It? How Can We Know? by Philip
  Tetlock: Tetlock’s examination of expert forecasts reveals how
  overconfidence and narrow thinking undermine predictive accuracy. In
  an era saturated with bold predictions from pundits, social media
  influencers, and algorithms, his findings underscore the value of
  open-minded skepticism. They hint that embracing complexity and
  uncertainty may be the key to better decisions in an unpredictable
  future.
- Niksen: The Dutch Art of Doing Nothing by Annette Lavrijsen:
  Lavrijsen’s guide to intentional idleness contrasts sharply with our
  relentless quest for productivity. At a time when stress-related
  health issues are on the rise, the principle of niksen suggests that
  doing “nothing” can be a transformative act of self-care. It hints at
  a future where deliberate rest and mental pauses may become as vital
  as any technological innovation.
- The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy’s View of History by
  Isaiah Berlin: Berlin’s timeless distinction between the single-minded
  “hedgehog” and the multifaceted “fox” offers a framework for
  interpreting complex world events. As global challenges become more
  interconnected, the ability to balance overarching theories with
  granular realities grows ever more important. This essay predicts that
  those who can juggle diverse perspectives stand the best chance of
  navigating an uncertain future.
