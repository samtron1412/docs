   he invented the phrase, "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity", which was
   later used by people who supported the Revolution. He is also known
   for writing about the noble savage.
5. Thomas Jefferson: (1743-1826) the third President of the U.S., from
   1801 to 1809. Jefferson was an important member of the Continental

   became Prime Minister in 1988, and in 1993 she was elected a second
   time. In 1996 she was forced to leave her position and live in exile
   because some people believed she had used government money
   dishonestly. She returned to Pakistan in 2007 and was killed in a
   bomb attack while she was campaigning to be elected prime minister
   for a third time.
10. Mary Wollstonecraft: (1759-1797) a British writer who is regarded as

13. Margaret Mead: (1901-1978) a US anthropologist, who studied the ways
    in which parents on the islands of Samoa, Bali, and New Guinea
    taught their children. She also tried to discover whether males and

    whether they learn to behave differently as they grow up in their
    particular societies. Her best-known book is Coming of Age in Samoa.
14. Martin Luther King Jr.: (1929-1968) a black US religious leader who
    became the most important leader of the Civil Rights Movement and
    worked hard to achieve social changes for African-American people.
    He was known for being a great public speaker, and many people
    remember his famous speech that starts with the words "I have a
    dream". He encouraged people to try to achieve changed without using

## Six Great Ideas

In each section, the author provides introduction and a number of
question in beginning to give students a baseline for their own
thoughts. Then, the author provides a number of follow-up questions at
the end of each section to help students see how much they have absorbed
from the authors they have studied.

1. Government, with an emphasis on democracy, is in many respects one of
   the most important ideas of modern times.
2. Culture includes a number of social issues: gender studies, issues of
   justice, prejudice, and a range of historical perspectives that
   affect all of us.
3. Wealth centers on the history of economics and how people have
   interpreted the effects of money on society. In a society facing
   massive inequalities, it helps to understand how important thinkers
   square the stress that great wealth has put upon democratic
   governments.
4. Mind introduces several important issues: the question of the
   unconscious and its effect on our lives; the mind-body problem, which
   has an effect on faith; and the question of how a physical body can
   produce consciousness. Introducing basic ideas in classical
   psychology.
5. Science focuses more on the scientific way of thinking than on
   specific details. Darwin's ideas about evolution and Newtonian and
   Einsteinian theories of gravity stand next to a major modern concern:
   how our understanding of genetics will ultimately change the genes of
   human beings.
6. Ethics appropriately follows the first five sections because the
   behavior of government, cultural forces, economists, brain and mind
   studies, and scientific upheavals all must be governed by the best
   understanding of ethical principles that will avoid injustice and
   oppression.

## Evaluating Ideas: An Introduction to Critical Reading

Processes
1. Prereading: read the summary to develop a sense of what the piece is
   about and its general purposes.
   + the broader issues and central questions
   + background on the writer
   + the main rhetorical or stylistic methods
2. Annotating: author's main arguments, how the author defends it.
    + key sentences - definitions and statements of purpose
    + key words
    + note the topic of paragraphs in the margins
    + ask questions in the margins
    + make notes in the margins to remind yourself to develop ideas
      later.
    + mark passages you might want to quote
    + points which you disagree
3. Questioning: raising issues
4. Reviewing: rereading in order to grasp the entire picture, writing a
   summary.
   + after a careful reading
   + account for the primary ideas that have been uncovered by your
     annotations and underlinings.
5. Forming your own ideas
    + develop your own positions on issues
    + your own assumptions and arguments

# Government

## Niccolò Machiavelli: The Qualities of the Prince

Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527) was an aristocrat whose fortunes wavered
according to the shifts in power in Florence.
    + The Prince (1513), his most celebrated work, was a general
      treatise on the qualities the prince (ruler) must have to maintain
      his power.
    + In more particular way, it was directed at the Medicis to
      encourage them to save Italy from the predatory incursions of
      France and Spain.
    + Machiavelli recommends a very practical course of action for the
      prince: secure power by direct and effective means.
    + Machiavelli's view of human nature has come under criticism for
      its cynicism: a morally good person would not remain long in any
      high office because that person would have to compete with the
      mass of people, who are basically bad.

| Lao- Tsu                                                              | Machiavelli                                                                                |
| -                                                                     | -                                                                                          |
| Lao-Tsu's advice issues from a detached view of a universal ruler     | Machiavelli's advice is very personal, embodying a set of directives for a specific prince |
| Lao-Tsu advises that judicious inaction will produce the best results | Machiavelli expounds on a litany of actions that must be taken                             |

### Machiavelli's Rhetoric

- Less poetic and more pragmatic. A how-to book, relevant to a
  particular time and place. Each segment of the discussion is terse and
  economical.
- Machiavelli announces primary points clearly, refers to historical
  precedents to support his points, and then why his position is the
  best one by appealing to both common sense and historical experience.
- When he suspects the reader will not share his view wholeheartedly, he
  suggests an alternative argument and then explains why it is wrong.
- Discussing opposite pairings, including both sides of an issue. The
  art of war and the art of life, liberality and stinginess, cruelty and
  clemency, the fox and the lion.
- The aphorism (a concise statement of a principle that has been
  accepted as true)

### The Qualities of the Prince

#### A Prince's Duty Concerning Military Matters

- The prince's profession should be war.
    + When princes have given more thought to personal luxuries than to
    arms, they have lost their state.
    + Examples: Francesco Sforza became Duke of Milan
    + Being disarmed makes you despised. Is this true for today?
- Training: action/mind: keeping his solders well disciplined and
  trained
    + Knowledge of terrain: know how mountains slope, how valleys open,
      how plains lie, and understand the nature of rivers and swamps
    + Two benefits: better understand how to defend it; explore other
      places
    + Examples: Philopoemon, Prince of the Achaeans
    + In peacetime he thought of nothing except the means of waging war.
      Is this true for today?
    + Can we use the technique of reasoning in other situations?
    + Exercise of the mind, reading histories and study the deeds of
      great men: the reasons for their victories and for their defeats
      (Cyrus, Achilles, Caesar, Alexander the Great, Scipio).
+ Never in peaceful times must he be idle. Turning them diligently to
  his advantage

#### On Those Things for Which Men, and Particularly Princes, Are Praised or Blamed

- Method and procedures of a prince in dealing with his subjects and
  friends
    + Those who are good at all times come to ruin among those who are
      not good.
    + Prince must learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge or
      not to use it according to necessity.
- Reputation for the vices
    + A prince must be prudent enough to know how to escape the bad
      reputation of those vices that would lose the state for him, and
      must protect himself from those that will not lose it for him, if
      this is possible; but if he cannot, he need not concern himself
      unduly if he ignores these less serious vices. And, moreover, he
      need not worry about incurring the bad reputation of those vices
      without which it would be difficult to hold his state.
    + Some virtues may end in destruction
    + What is the definition of virtues and vices? They are relative
      terms, and we have to look at it in Machiavelli's view to
      understand what his means.

#### On Generosity and Miserliness

- It would be good to be considered generous. Is this always true? If
  not, when it is true or false?
- Nevertheless, generosity used in such a manner as to give you a
  reputation for it will harm you. Reputation not a real value?
    + not to neglect any possible means of lavish display
    + use up all his resources and he will be obliged to burden people
      with excessive taxes and to do everything possible to raise funds
    + make  him hateful to his subjects
    + offend many and reward few
    + recognizing this and wishing to alter his policies, he immediately
      runs the risk of being reproached as a miser
- A wise prince should not worry about being called a miser. (It only a
  fake reputation not a real value)
    + as a result of his parsimony, his income is sufficient, he can
      defend himself from anyone who makes war against him.
    + undertake enterprises without overburdening his people
    + he comes to be generous with all those from whom he takes nothing
    who are countless, and miserly with all those to whom he gives
    nothing, who are few.
    + Examples: Pope Julius II, present King of France, present King of
      Spain
- miser is one of those vices that permits him to rule.
    + not to have to rob his subjects
    + not to become poor and contemptible
    + not to be forced to become rapacious
    + Examples: Caesar
    + either already a prince or on the way to becoming one; in the
      first instance such generosity is damaging; in the second it is
      very necessary
    + a prince either spends his own money and that of his subjects or
      that of others; in the first case he must be economical; in the
      second he must not restrain any part of his generosity.
    + what does not belong to you or to you subjects you can be a more
      liberal giver
    + spending the wealth of others does not lessen your reputation but
      adds to it; only the spending of your own is what harms you.
- it is wiser to live with the reputation of a miser, which produces
  reproach without hatred, than to be forced to incur the reputation of
  rapacity, which produces reproach along with hatred, because you want
  to be considered as generous.

#### On Cruelty and Mercy and Whether It Is Better to Be Loved than to Be Feared or the Contrary

- Every prince must desire to be considered merciful and not cruel. Is
  this always true? If not, when it is true or false?
- Nonetheless, he must take care not to misuse this mercy.
    + Examples: Cesare  Borgia
    + A prince must not worry about the reproach of cruelty when it is a
      matter of keeping his subjects united and loyal
    + community larger than individual
- Nevertheless, a prince must be cautious in believing and in acting,
  nor should he be afraid of his own shadow
- One should like to be loved and to be feared, but since it is
  difficult to join them together, it is much safer to be feared than to
  be loved when one of the two must be lacking.
    + make himself feared in such a manner that he will avoid hatred. He
      should avoid the property of others
    + He not worry about being considered cruel in his armies
    + Examples: Scipio
- men love at their own pleasure and fear at the pleasure of the prince,
  a wise prince should build his foundation upon that which belongs to
  him, not upon that which belongs to others: he must strive only to
  avoid hatred.

#### How a Prince Should Keep His Word

- It is praiseworthy for a prince to keep his word and to live by
  integrity and not by deceit everyone.
    + Is this always true? If not, when it is true or false?
- Nevertheless, princes who have accomplished great deeds are those who
  have cared little for keeping their promises and who have known how to
  manipulate the minds of men by shrewdness.
- Two means of fighting: one according to the laws, the other with
  force; the first way is proper to man, the second to beasts
- A prince must know how to use wisely the natures of the beast and the
  man.
    + Examples: Achilles
- A wise ruler cannot and should not keep his word when such an
  observance of faith would be to his disadvantage and when the reasons
  which made him promise and removed.
    + If men are not keep their promises to  you, you likewise  need not
      keep yours to them.
    + one who deceives will always find another who will allow himself
      to be deceived.
    + Examples: Alexander VI
- having them and practicing them at all times is harmful; and appearing
  to have them is useful
    + he should not stray from the good, but he should know how to enter
      into evil when necessity commands.
- A prince must be very careful never to let anything slip from his
  lips which is not full of the five qualities mentioned above: he
  should appear, upon seeing and hearing him, to be all mercy, all
  faithfulness, all integrity, all kindness, all religion.
    + men is general judge more by their eyes than their hands; for
    everyone can see but few can feel.
    + ordinary people are always deceived by appearances

#### On Avoiding Being Despised and Hated

- a prince should think about avoiding those things which made him hated
  and despised
    + being rapacious and a usurper of the property and the women of his
      subjects are things that make him hated
    + what makes him despised: being considered changeable, frivolous,
      effeminate, cowardly, irresolute
- strive to make everyone recognize in his actions greatness, spirit,
  dignity, and strength
    + he must insist that his decision be irrevocable
    + maintain himself in such a way that no man could imagine that he
      can deceive or cheat him
- two fears: one, internal, concerning his subjects; the other,
  external, concerning foreign powers.
    + the external one he can defends himself by his good troops and
      friends
    + the internal affairs will always be stable when external affairs
      are stable
    + when external affairs do not change, he has to fear that they may
      conspire secretly
        * securing by avoiding being hated or despised and by keeping
          the people satisfied with him
        * Examples: Messer Annibale Bentivoglio
- A prince must be little concerned with conspiracies when the people
  are well disposed toward him; but when the populace is hostile and
  regards him with hatred, he must fear everything and everyone.
- Well-organized states and wise princes have taken care not to anger
  the nobles and to satisfy the common people and keep them contented

## Jean-Jacques Rousseau: The Origin of Civil Society

### Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778)

- Rousseau's father is a watchmaker in Geneva, Switzerland.
- Shortly after his birth, Rousseau's mother died, and a rash duel
forced his father from Geneva.
- Rousseau was then apprenticed at age thirteen to an engraver, a master
who treated him badly.
- He soon ran away from his master and found a home with a Catholic
noblewoman who at first raised him as her son and then, when he was
twenty, took him as her lover. In the process Rousseau converted from
Calvinist Protestantism to Roman Catholicism.
- Eventually, he left Switzerland for Paris, where he won an important
essay contest and became celebrated in society.
- He argued against Grotius by examining the way things ought to be. He
argued against Hobbes by asserting that both the body politic and the
monarch were sovereign and that when people created a civil society they
surrendered their freedom to themselves as a group. If one person acted
as sovereign or lawgiver, then that lawgiver had the responsibility of
acting in accord with the will of the people. In a sense, this view
parallels some of the view of Lao-tzu in the Tao-te Ching.
- Geneva put out a warrant for his arrest upon the publication of The
Social Contract because although it praised Geneva's republicanism, it
also condemned societies that depended on rule by a limited aristocracy.
- Similarly, after the publication of Emile offended the french
parliament, Rousseau was forced to abandon his comfortable rustic
circumstances - living on country estates provided by patrons from the
court - and spend the rest of his life in financial uncertainty.
- In 1789, a decade after his death, Rousseau's philosophy was adopted
by supporters of the French Revolution.

### Rousseau's Rhetoric

- Antagonistic: he establishes the views of other thinkers, counters
them, and then offers his own ideas.
- Using analysis and examination of detail.
- Using aphorism and analogy.
    + The family is the only natural form of society. Children are bound
    to the father only as long as they need him. Once they are able to
    be independent, they dissolve the natural bond.
- Testimony: he paraphrases the views of other authorities and move on
to promote his own.
- Rousseau concentrates on the question of man in nature, or natural
society.

### The Origin of Civil Society

#### Prereading questions

1. When Rousseau says, "Man is born free; and everywhere he is in
chains," does he seem to be referring literally to slaves in chains or
more figuratively to people in general?
2. How convincing is Rousseau when he claims that the oldest form of
government is the family?
3. The "Social Contrast" is one of Rousseau's chief ideas. What does it
seem to mean?

#### Note

- Inquiring the laws of societies.
    + Why?
- Without proving the importance of the subject.
    + Why?
- Why do I write on politics?
    + If i were a prince or a legislator, I should not waste time in
    saying what wants doing; I should do it, or hold my peace.
- The right of voting on them makes it my duty to study them.
    + Why is it a duty? In order to vote you have to know and
    understand it.
- Reflecting upon governments provides new reasons for loving his own
country.

#### Subject of the First Book

- Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains.
    + Man is each person in general.
    + What kind of chains?
    + What is the meaning of born free? Free of what?
- Only considering force and the effects derived from it.
    + "As long as a people is compelled to obey, and obeys, it does
    well; as soon as it can shake off the yoke, and shakes it off, it
    does still better; for, regaining its liberty by the same right as
    took it away, either it is justified in resuming it, or there was
    no justification for those who took it away."
    + Does it true when it only is justification or no justification?
- The social order is a sacred right which is the basis of all other
rights.
    + Where is this come from? Why?
- Nevertheless, the social order does not come from nature, and must
therefore be founded on conventions.
    + Does it true?

#### The First Societies

- The most ancient of all societies, and the only one that is natural,
is the family.

#### The Right of the Strongest

#### Slavery

#### That We Must Always Go Back to a First Convention

#### The Social Compact

#### The Sovereign

#### The Civil State

#### Real Property

## Thomas Jefferson: The Declaration of Independence

### Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826)

- He composed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 in the watchful
eyes of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and the rest of the Continental
Congress, who spent two and a half days going over every word.
- Jefferson rose to eminence in a time of great political upheaval.
- After the Revolutionary War he moved into the national political arena
as the first secretary of state (1790-1793). He then served as John
Adams's vice president (1797-1801) and was himself elected president in
1800.
- Perhaps one of his greatest achievements during his two terms
(1801-1809) in office was his negotiation of the Louisiana Purchase, in
which the United States acquired from France 828,000 square miles of
land west of the Mississippi for about 15 million dollar.
- One of the fundamental paradoxes of Jefferson's personal and political
life has been his attitude toward slavery. Like most wealthy Virginians,
Jefferson owned slaves. However, in 1784 he tried to abolish slavery in
the western territories that were being added to the United States.
- Rousseau's republican philosophies greatly influenced Jefferson's
works.

### Jefferson's rhetoric

- Using periodic sentences with balance and parallelism.
- Causal analysis. One understood things best when one understood their
causes. Listing the list of causes.
- The technique of repetition of the same words at the beginning of
successive lines is called **anaphora**.

### The Declaration of Independence

#### Prereading questions

1. Under what conditions may a people alter or abolish their government?
2. Why does Jefferson consider King George a tyrant?

#### The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America

## Ralph Waldo Emerson: Politics

### Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882)

- Emerson was the son of a Unitarian minister from a family that dates
back to the Puritans.
- He was educated at Harvard College and, after a few years teaching at
a girls' school in Boston, went to the Harvard Divinity School to prepare
for the ministry.
- Ill health made it problematic for him to continue a preacher at the
Second Church of Boston. He left that post a few years after the death
of his first wife (at age twenty) and after a later personal crisis of
faith.
- From 1832 through 1833, he toured Europe and met with some of the most
distinguished literary figures of the age: William Wordsworth, Samuel
Taylor Coleridge, and Thomas Carlyle, who became an enduring friend. He
also read widely in Eastern religion and philosophy as well as in Plate
and other traditional philosophers.
- When he returned from Europe, Emerson rarely preached in church. He
married again and had a family; his first wife's legacy enabled him to
devote his time to reading and writing.
- His first major essay, *Nature* (1836), was published anonymously but
later appeared in book form (1849) under his name.
    + In this essay, he distilled the thoughts he had been collecting in
      his journals since college.
    + He saw himself firmly positioned in nature and saw that nature
      reflected the mind of God.
    + He began to conceive of the idea of the **Over-Soul**, the
      **Universal Mind** that comprehends all things, and this idea then
      fed into his concept of the **transcendental man**, the intuitive
      thinker who could, like Plate, see beyond surface materialism into
      the **true meaning** of the world.
    + Transcendentalism became a movement in New England from the first
    publication of *Nature* until the beginning of the Civil War in
    1860.
        * It was basically a rejection of the intense emphasis on pure
          reason by the eighteenth-century philosophers.
        * Rather, it proposed an intuitive understanding on the part of
          the individual to perceive directly the nature of things.
        * Transcendentalism was never codified or made into a coherent
        philosophy because it was centered on the individual and was
        seen as an expression of the individual's direct apprehension of
        the divine spirit in nature.
- *Politics* in *Essays: Second Series*
    + The concerns of a man in his late thirties, and they sometimes
    reveal a brashness(recklessness) characteristic of youth empowered
    by great thoughts.
        * Emerson was widely read throughout much of the
        English-speaking world. He was one of a remarkable number of
        star lecturers who became famous for speeches delivered in
        athenaeums(institutions for literary) throughout the United
        States.
- Emerson was deeply involved in the abolition movement in the United
States, and he was also involved in the intellectual life around him.
    + Henry David Thoreau was a very close friend.
- Emerson went his own way and sometimes paid a price for doing so. For
example, he delivered one of his most famous lectures to the Divinity
School at Harvard in 1838. Now called the "Divinity School Address,"
this lecture is essentially an attack on all formal religious
institutions and a call for the individual to perceive the spirit of
divinity intuitively. Religious experience was more important to him
than religion itself. As a result of this address, for thirty years,
Harvard refused to let him speak there.

### Emerson's Rhetoric

- His emphasis on individualism commands his observations throughout the
essay, especially when he points to the question of character in any
community.
- He was a gifted speaker, he tends to comment at length in a manner
that much resembles someone on a podium (stand place when someone does
public-speaking).
    + His paragraph are lengthy.
    + Explanatory than an effort to convince the listener of a specific
    position.
    + His emphasis on the pronoun "we" connects him to his audience and
    assures us that he is one with us.
    + Quotable aphorisms.
- Metaphors.
    + "the wise know that foolish legislation is a rope of sand which
    perishes in the twisting", which he uses to discourage the young
    from being too eager to pass new laws.
    + "statute is a currency which we stamp with our own portrait", a
    law is to be thought of as a kind of cash that binds us.
- A central issue in *Politics* is the question of how the state
guarantees the safety of the individual and the protection of property.
    + The Constitution makes special mention of the protection of
    property and so does Emerson.
- Emerson has been praised in this essay for his emphasis on the
individual's personal rights in the state, but he has been criticized
for his special pleading for the preservation of property.
    + "that the highest end of government is the culture of men; and
    that if men can be educated, the institutions will share their
    improvement and the moral sentiment will write the law of the land"

### Politics

#### Prereading questions

1. What is the relationship of the state to the citizen?
2. What are the rights of the citizen?
3. What is the government's role in relation to property?
4. How much government does Emerson recommend?

#### Contents

- The State's institutions are not superior to the citizen; every law
and usage was a man's expedient (resources) to meet a particular case;
they are imitable, alterable; we may make better.
- Society is an illusion to the young citizen: rooted to the center
- The old statesman knows that society is fluid: any particle may become
the center of the movement and compel the system to gyrate (spin) round
it.

## Jacob A. Riis: The Color Line in New York

### Jacob A. Riis (1849-1914)

- Riis as a twenty-one-year-old Danish immigrant to New York, found
  himself in shelters a desperate situation and unable to get work. He
  almost gave up hope, subsisting in shelters brutally run by the police
  in their station cellars and then eventually living on the streets.
  Fortunately, he was befriended by the principal of Cooper Union, who
  got him a job writing about a luncheon (lunch) at Astor House. His
  article was good enough to secure him work for the New York News
  Association. He became editor of South Brooklyn News, but the paper,
  which was a political news organ, went bankrupt. Riis bought the
  company with some promissory notes and his savings of 75 dollar and
  ran it independently for a time. Eventually, the political group
  decided to buy it back and paid Riis five times his original
  investment.
- He became a police reporter on the New York Tribune. He was assigned
  the most dangerous areas of the city to cover. The Five Points area
  was notorious. But Riis made a point of walking through the most
  dangerous areas and the worst slums. He spent a great deal of time in
  the locations in which the poor suffered most painfully. As a result
  of his experience observing poverty in New York, he published a short
  piece on tenement life for *Scribner's Magazine*. It developed into
  his first, and most famous, book, How the Other Half Lives: Studies
  among the Tenements of New York (Scribner's, 1890).
- Riis was a type of journalist called a "muckraker" because he called
  society's attention to unpleasant issues. He became a photographer
  because photographs provided a more forceful way to make his point
  about the miseries of the poor in late-nineteenth-century New York. He
  bought a camera when the first flash photography was invented, making
  it possible for him to photograph the interior of many squalid
  tenements. He brought these conditions to the notice of Theodore
  Roosevelt, who was then the New York City Police Commissioner.
  Roosevelt accompanied Riis in his work recording the miseries of the
  impoverished. Riis is considered on of the first photojournalists.
- Riis had some conventional prejudices regarding the major impoverished
  groups: the Italians, the Jews, the bohemians (Czechs and Slovaks),
  and the African Americans. He often complained of some groups'
  inability to maintain sanitation and of their unwillingness to make
  changes that might have improved their lives. But these views did not
  prevent him from working on their behalf (interest). His journalism is
  credited with helping to transform the slums of New York and changing
  the sanitary conditions in which hundreds of thousands lived.

### Riis's Rhetoric

- As a result of his experience as a reporter and as an editor of a
newspaper, Riis writes in a no-nonsense fashion.
- His paragraphs are distinct and long in the fashion of the papers of
his day. Rarely does on paragraph move in easy transition to the next --
each seems a seperate entity.
- He makes some limited use of rhetorical techniques such as metaphor or
testimony, but on the whole, the most important rhetorical resource for
Riis is the facts.
- A number of other authors produced books in the 1870s and the 1890s,
but most of those books were formal, moralistic, and distant from their
subject. What made How the Other Half Lives successful was the
directness and the simplicity of its language.
    + Riis uses statistics and facts to make his point.
- Another of his techniques is the use of example. Riis seems to have
had a special interest in Christmas.
- Riis is unembarrassed to provide what he feels are the facts about the
behavior of all the ethnic groups he describes in his book.
- His references to recent history (slavery and union of the united
states) and his analysis of circumstances made his work distinctive.
- Riis approaches the act of writing as a direct and essentially simple
task. Each of his paragraphs begins with a controlling or topic sentence
that declares the subject of the paragraph.
    + The first paragraph introduces the prejudices of the landlord.
    + The second explains that there may be some hope that the "color
    line" may be weakening and positive change may come.
    + The third focuses on the migration of African Americans north
    since the Civil War and describes the qualities he observes in them.

### Prereading questions

1. What does Jacob Riis tell us about tenement life?
2. How distinct and separate are the ethnic groups Riis describes?
3. How does racial prejudice affect the business practices of landlords?
4. What are Riis's own prejudices? How do they affect his reporting?

### The Color Line in New York

## John Rawls: A Theory of Justice

### John Rawls (1921-2002)

- Rawls was widely considered one of the most distinguished moral
philosophers of the second half of the twentieth century.
- He was educated at Princeton University and served in the 32nd
Infantry Division in New Guinea and the Philippines from 1943 to 1946.
After returning to Princeton for his doctorate, he taught at Cornell,
Oxford, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and finally Harvard
University, where he was Conant University Professor, the highest-level
professorship at the university.
- Rawls began to work out the ideas that eventually formed his most
important book, A Theory of Justice (1971), in the 1950s, both in his
earliest articles and in his notes for his lectures and teaching. He
spent more than ten years refining his thinking on the subject, and in
the process began to attract the attention of other thinkers concerned
with problems of justice and equality.
- In essence, he changed the direction of thought away from the
utilitarian - a system of justice that benefits the greatest number with
the greatest good - to a system of justice based on fairness, in which
any social action must be measured by its effect on the least advantaged
people in the society. Rawls argued that if a social action were to harm
an individual, that action should be avoided.
- In A Theory of Justice, Rawls develops two basic ideas: the "original
position" and the "veil of ignorance." In what is called a thought
experiment similar to Plato's "The Allegory of the Cave", Rawls proposes
a version of a social contract much like Rousseau's. However, the
principles are different. In the "original position" concept, Rawls
proposes an original starting point for a society in which the designers
of the society make certain assumptions about the "Primary Goods" -
freedom, equality, opportunity, wealth, powers, and income - that each
person in the society must have. The planners of the society, much like
Thomas Jefferson and those who constructed our Constitution, were to
take into consideration all the desirable qualities important to a
rational society.
- Then, to make things more interesting and fair, Rawls devised the
concept of the "veil of ignorance" in which the planners and the members
of the society made their decisions about the Primary Goods without
knowing where they themselves would actually fall in the society in
terms of their sex, race, birth, or talent. If they were kept ignorant
of those facts, Rawls believed, their decisions would not be biased by
personal circumstances. Rawls assumed that every individual was directed
by self-interest first, so the "veil of ignorance" would prevent the
creation of a social structure that would benefit only those who were
deciding how justice would be allocated.
- Above all, Rawls believed that justice must be fair and that the
rights of the individual should never be sacrificed for the greater good
of society. Personal freedom insofar as it did not impinge (negatively
affect) on the freedom of others was on of his most sacred value.
Underlying all these ideas is the insistence that people are equal and
should be treated equally.
- One of Rawls's most controversial ideas is often referred to as the
"difference principle." Rawls felt that any inequality produced by a
social structure must be measured by its effect on the least advantaged
people in the society.
    + For instance, a tax structure that produced inequality of wealth
      in a community must be measured by its harmful or beneficial
      effect on those who are least wealthy, and not on the middle class
      or those with the most advantages.
    + This position has been attacked in part because it seems to
      penalize those who have the talent to create wealth for
      themselves. Rawls responds by suggesting that the society he
      envisions can accept a certain amount of inequality of
      distribution of wealth, as long as it does not upset the
      equilibrium of the society.
    + Exactly how this position is worked out in practice is not clear,
      but on a theoretical level it seems to suggest that a certain
      amount of unequal distribution of Primary Goods could result in an
      internal revolution, thus destroying the equilibrium of the
      society as a result of a perceived injustice.
    + Justice cannot be fair if only a certain group has most of the
      wealth, opportunities, power, or income. Such a situation
      constitutes a loss of equilibrium.

### Rawls's Rhetoric

- Rawls is not considered a stylish writer; his purpose is not to
convince us by means of a poetic or graceful style, but to present the
basic ingredients of an argument.
    + He begins with principles that are carefully defined, then moves
    on to show us how these principles would be applied and in what
    conditions they would be appropriate.
    + This is a method that demands careful attention from the first
    sentences onward because everything flows from those early
    statements.
- He begins with related theories, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
social contract, which suggests that people in a society agree to an
unspoken contract that binds them to accept the conditions of the
society or else leave.
    + But Rawls ignores the bases of the contracts proposed by Rousseau
    and others, and by contrast alludes (suggests) to principles that
    "free and rational persons concerned to further their own interests
    would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the
    fundamental terms of their association".
    + Rawls ends his first paragraph with a statement of purpose and
    definition: "This way of regrading the principles of justice I
    shall call justice as fairness." This principle is fundamental to
    his argument.
- Rawls develops the concept of the "original position" in the third
paragraph: "This original position...is understood as a purely
hypothetical situation characterized so as to lead to a certain
conception of justice." Whereas Rousseau refers to a "state of nature"
that may have existed in which people bound themselves to a society,
Rawls attempts to formulate an ideal or hypothetical situation that
conforms with views that he feels may guarantee fairness.
- The four paragraph examines the idea that justice should guarantee
fairness to everyone in the society. Rawls considers the nature of
cooperation that naturally pertains to a social order in which people
voluntarily and rationally decide to join.
- In paragraph 5, he addresses the question of interest, a term he uses
to clarify the position of individuals in a just society. When he states
that individuals are "rational and mutually disinterested," he means
that individuals make decisions based on their own concerns, not those
of others. A disinterested decision could only be made by someone who
does not benefit from the outcome.
- The original position must decide what "conception of justice as
fairness" they will choose. To be sure, this is a difficult concept.
    + The framers of the U.S. Constitution faced a similar prospect, and
    despite their concern with equality and fairness, they ignored the
    conditions of the least advantaged in their society: slaves.
    + In the sixth paragraph, Rawls mentions the principle of utility,
    in that view, the Constitution achieved a utilitarian end, but that
    does not satisfy Rawls because it ignores the rights of the least
    advantaged.
- The seventh paragraph establishes the bedrock principles by which
Rawls expects justice to be established.
    + The planners of the society must assign "rights and duties" in an
    equal fashion.
    + Economic inequities can be tolerated only if they benefit the
    least advantaged members of society.
- Several of the later paragraphs examine what Rawls calls "the merit
of the contract terminology" so that we will have as firm an
understanding of the idea of the social contract as we can.

### Prereading questions

1. How does Rawls articulate (express) his idea of "justice as fairness"?
2. What are the "primary goods" that people in a society need?
3. What is Rawls's attitude toward the least advantaged people in
society?

### A Theory of Justice

- "My aim is to present a conception of justice which generalizes and
carries to a higher level of abstraction the familiar theory of the
social contract as found, say, in Locke, Rousseau, and Kant."
    + The original contract is not a thing to enter a particular society
    or to set up a particular form of government.
    + Rather, the principles of justice for the basic structure of
    society are the object of the original agreement.
    + They are the principles that people would accept in an initial
    position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their
    association (organization, society, community).
    + These principles are to regulate (control) all further agreement.
    + "I shall call justice as fairness."
- The foundation charter (treaty, agreement, constitution) of their
society.
- Much less as a primitive (basic, original) condition of culture.
- The principles of justice are chosen behind a veil of ignorance.
    + This ensures that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged in the
    choice of principles by the outcome of natural chance or the
    contingency (possibility) of social circumstances.

## Margaret Mead: Sex and Temperament

### Margaret Mead (1901-1978)

- She received her Ph.D. in anthropology from Columbia University in
1929.
- *Coming of Age in Samoa: A Psychological Study of Primitive Youth for
Western Civilization* (1928)
- She learned seven indigenous (native) languages and always used them
with the people she studied and lived with so that she could think in
their vernacular (mother tongue, native language).
- *Growing Up in New Guinea: A Comparative Study of Primitive Education*
(1930).
- Mead was married three times, as she tell us in her autobiography,
*Blackberry Winter* (1972).
- Her primary research interests were the patterns of education of the
young and the patterns of socialization of women and women's sexuality,
particularly early sexual development.
    + Mead asserted that cultural mores are relative and that there are
    many ways of working out the details of courtship, sex, marriage,
    and love.
    + She consistently argued that there is no right way, suggesting
    rather that there are many ways, all of which are right within and
    individual culture.
- Mead emphasizes the psychological model of cultures. She also
emphasizes the social, traditional, and historical aspects of a culture
while concerning herself less with the biological or genetic.
    + Recent critics have faulted Mead for this emphasis and have
    charged her with ignoring biological determinism in her research.
- Near the end of her life, Mead was the most famous anthropologist in
the United States. She wrote columns for popular magazines, published
more than twenty books, and lectured widely to various audiences.

### Mead's Rhetoric

- Mead has the advantages of writing clearly and with a journalist's
skill, focusing on the most interesting details.
- "Sex and Temperament" explores society's expectations regarding
temperament rather than trying to convince the reader that one or
another of the points of view is accurate.
- As she says in her opening paragraphs, she is not interested in
determining if there are "actual and universal differences between the
sexes." Instead, she is concerned with the range of temperaments -
"dominance, bravery, aggressiveness, objectivity, maleability" (para. 6)
- that human beings can have and all the other temperamental qualities
individuals can possess. Then, she goes on to explore whether any
specific group of temperaments is explicitly limited to one sex or the
other.
- She admits that, at the beginning of her study, "[she] too had been
accustomed to use in [her] thinking such concepts as 'mixed type,' to
think of some men as having 'feminine' temperaments, of some women as
having 'masculine' minds" (para. 6). In other words, she originally felt
that there was a natural disposition of temperaments that was inbuilt
depending on sex. Then, her work among other cultures, her thinking
began to change. Ultimately, she realized that each culture begins
shaping individuals at birth to fit the patterns that it has determined
as most desirable.
    + As she says, there are several courses of action available to a
    society.
    + One is to emphasize contrasting temperaments in boys and girls.
    + Another is to de-emphasize differences and concentrate on
    individual talent and natural temperament in determining occupation
    and behavior, a condition that Mead seems to imply is in place in
    her own time.
    + However, she is worried that we may "return to a strict
    regimentation of women" (para. 9) in the future. She also "admit
    that men and women are capable of being molded to a single
    pattern as easily as to a diverse one" (para. 11).
- She is careful to point out that standard biologically relevant
distinctions.
- Two of her rhetorical techniques are comparison and example.
    + In any society in which such rigid temperamental qualities are
    educated into either sex, there will be a considerable number of
    rebels.
    + She also exhibits considerable concern for individuals in a
    society that places great emphasis on gender-elated temperaments
    when those individuals do not themselves have the "proper"
    temperaments.
    + Mead proposes an experiment in which the temperamental
    distinctions that our society assumes are natural to men and women
    were linked to eye color instead of gender.
- Mead's final suggestion is to avoid standardizing society or removing
all of society's expectations. Instead, she suggests that society might
learn to tolerate and accept the natural diversity within a population
of many individuals with differing temperaments.

### Prereading questions

1. What does Mead mean by temperament?
2. What is a "standardized" society?
3. What alternatives are there to a standardized society?
4. Do all societies regard men and women as different in temperament?

## Neil Postman: The Word Weavers/The World Makers

### Neil Postman (1931-2003)

- In 1958, while a graduate student at Columbia University, he taught at
San Francisco State University, which was then at the center of original
work in semantics, the science of the study of meaning in words.
- Postman was influenced by other semanticists and developed his own
views of the media and the influence of electronic forms of
communication.
- In 1961, Postman published his first book, *Television and the
Teaching of English*, in which he applied the theories of linguistics and
semantics to teaching English in primary and secondary schools.
    + He followed this book with a series of related texts called *The
    New English* for grades 7 to 12, which also focused on English
    education.
    + In these books, he reviews the effects of various media
    on language and words and describes the power of television to
    deliver meaning and shape language (though he would later come to
    reverse this stance(opinion)).
- *Teaching as a Subversive Activity* (1969), which he wrote with
Charles Weingartner, was another highly influential book that questioned
many of the assumptions about education across the board, not just those
regarding English education.
    + They press the issue of how language not only carries meaning but
    also shapes it.
    + Postman's point was that language competence was of enormous
    importance to K-12 students because it actually shaped the way they
    perceived and understood their culture.
- In the late 1970s, Postman began work on a trilogy of books designed
to alert educators to the problems involved with the use of media not
only in education but in the public sphere.
    + The first, *Teaching as a Conserving Activity* (1979), announced
    that his earlier work, which had praised the power of television and
    electronic media, needed a total revision. He had become aware that
    children did not need much special training to adapt to television.
    Instead, they needed much more training to deal with basic texts,
    such as books and printed material.
    + Second, *The Disappearance of Childhood* (1982), which discussed
    the entire idea of childhood, a concept that he felt was essentially
    recent. In the ancient world, children were not treated in a special
    way. But, Postman argued, by the middle of the nineteenth century
    through the beginning of the twentieth century a special place had
    been created in society specifically to accommodate children. He
    points to the power of television to influence chilldren by
    inundating them with adult content tat emphasizes consumerism,
    materialism, and adult hedonism. Much of Postman's later work was
    aimed at revealing the ways in which electronic media hindered the
    growth of those passively immersed in it.
    + Third, *Amusing Ourselves to Death: PUblic Discourse in the Age
    of Show Business* (1985). In this volume, Postman deals with the
    question of the effects on children of constant entertainment as a
    primary source of knowledge of the world. Postman considers that
    television and other electronic media damage to the intellectual
    capacity of those who depend on it because it is entirely devoted to
    light entertainment rather than thoughtful instruction.

### Postman's Rhetoric

- One of Postman's constant suggestions to writers is that they stress
**clarity** while writing.
    + He makes it clear that the world is complex and that we need a
    means to bring what we observe under control and make the
    complexities of experience manageable.
        * When he talks about a cup, for instance, he reminds us that no
        one can really perceive a cup in its entirely and that, even
        more importantly, no one can perceive the reality of a cup
        because it is a collection of molecules and atoms in constant
        motion. And even if we could perceive that, we may not be
        perceiving reality. We use a process of abstraction to create a
        concept of a cup, just as we do for other physical objects. Such
        concepts make it possible for us to maintain some control over
        our environment.
- Because Postman was a lifelong educator, his focus throughout the
selection is on the ways in which we learn and develop ideas and
concepts of the world.
    + His views on semantics are central to the entire essay.
    + He realizes as he writes that the fashion in English and language
      studies does not currently favor studies in semantics (which was
      wildly popular from the 1960s through the 1980s).
    + Semantics, he says, should not be limited to study in graduate
      school but should in fact be introduced in the lower grades, as he
      did repeatedly while teaching.
    + As he says, we learn by asking questions, and we need to know
      where the questions come from and how they are phrased - and we
      hope that the best questions will produce even better questions to
      help clarify areas of study.
    + In fact, Postman would like schools to pay special attention just
      to the idea of questions.
- The essay has a simple three-part structure, which helps Postman
achieve the kind of clarity he respects.
    + The first part focuses on three verbal issues: definition,
    questions, and metaphor.
        * It is important to know who gave it that definition and what
        other definitions of the word may be relevant.
        * "Everything we know has its origin in questions"
        * Metaphor: a comparison between two different things, the
        result of which is that one of those things is understood in a
        new way. If we liken the human mind to anything else
        metaphorically, then we reshape the way we understand the
        concept of the mind.
    + The second part of the essay focuses on the work of Alfred
    Korzybski, the "father" of semantics and an inspiration to Postman.
        * Postman provides a brief biography, then talks about
        Korzybski's major publications and makes an appeal for better
        understanding of semantics by clarifying Korzybski's original
        motivations in studying language.
        * A better education in language would help people have better
        control over their world and help them avoid the rush to war.
    + The final part returns to the three issues that are central to the
    opening pages: concepts of definition, questions, and metaphor, now
    developed in light of the ideas suggested by Korzybski's work.

## Karl Marx: The Communist Manifesto

### Karl Marx (1818-1883)

- Karl Marx was born ini Germany to Jewish parents who converted to
Lutheranism. A scholarly man, Marx studied literature and philosophy,
ultimately earning a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Jena.
After being denied a university position, he turned to journalism to
earn a living.
- Soon after beginning his journalistic career, Marx came into conflict
with Prussian authorities because of his radical social views, and after
a period of exile in Paris he moved to Brussels. After several more
moves, Marx found his way to London, where he finally settled in
absolute poverty; his friend Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) contributed
money to prevent Marx and his family from starving. During this time in
London, Marx wrote the books for which he is famous while also writing
for and editing newspapers. His contributions to the New York Daily
Tribune number over three hundred items between the years 1851 and 1862.
- Marx is best known for his theories of socialism, as expressed in
"The Communist Manifesto" (1848) - which, like much of his important
work, was written with Engels's help - and in the three-volume "Das
Kapital" (Capital), the first volume of which was published in 1867.
Vladimir Lenin (1870-1924) was a disciple whose triumph in the Russian
Revolution of 1917 catapulted Marx to the forefront of world thought.
Since 1917, Marx's thinking has been scrupulously analyzed, debated, and
argued. Capitalist thinkers have found him unconvincing, whereas
Communist thinkers have found him a prophet and keen analyst of social
structures.
- In England, Marx's studies centered on the concept of an ongoing class
struggle between who owned property - the bourgeoisie - and those who
owned nothing but whose work produced wealth - the proletariat. Marx was
concerned with the forces of history, and his view of history was that
it is progressive and, to an extent, inevitable. He defended the view
that economic institutions evolve naturally and that, in their
evolution, they control the social order. Thus, communism was an
inevitable part of the process, and in the Manifesto he worked to
clarify the reasons for its inevitability.
- One of Marx's primary contentions was that capital is "not a
personal, it is a social power" (para. 78). Thus, according to Marx, the
"past dominates the present" (para. 83) because the accumulation of past
capital determines how people will live in the present society.
Capitalist economists, however, see capital as a personal power, but a
power that, as John Kenneth Galbraith might say, should be used in a
socially responsible way.

### Marx's rhetoric

- Comparisons and contrasts in the first section "Bourgeois and
Proletarians"
- Marx's style is simple and direct. He moves steadily from point to
point, establishing his views on:
    + The nature of classes
    + The nature of bourgeois society
    + the questions of industrialism and its effects on modern society
- He considers wealth, worth, nationality, production, agriculture, and
machinery. Each point is addressed in turn, usually in its own
paragraph.
- The next section, "Proletarians and Communists" (paras. 60-133)
    + Show that the proletariat as the class of the future, and the
    Communist cause is the Proletarian cause.
    + He assumes that he is addresses by an antagonist (who opposes
    him), and then he proceeds to answer each popular complaint against
    communism.
    + Communists is not a party separate from other workers' parties
    (para. 61).
    + the question of abolishing existing property relations (paras.
    68-93)
    + the antagonism between capital and wage labor (para. 76)
    + the disappearance of culture (para. 94)
    + the questions of the family (paras. 98-100)
    + the exploitation of children (para. 101)
    + the new system of public education (paras. 102-104)
    + the community of women (paras. 105-110)
    + Communists want to abolish nations ??? (paras. 111-115)
    + He brushes aside religion (para. 116)
    + brief summary
    + ten-point program (para. 131)
- In the last section (paras. 135-145), in which Marx compares the
Communists with other reform groups.

## Andrew Carnegie: The Gospel of Wealth

### Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919)

- Andrew Carnegie was a truly self-made man.
- Working, studying, and using his talent to accumulate wealth.
- Using his property to contribute to public good: build institutions

### Carnegie's Rhetoric

- The word "Gospel" in the title: helping to distribute more widely
- The organization of the essay:
    + Posing a problem: "The problem of our age is the proper
    administration of wealth"
    + The inevitable of the Law of Accumulation of Wealth, and the Law
    of Competition. Praising the system that has produced so much
    wealth.
    + He condemns charity because he thinks it is inefficient.
    + He condemns those who would make a religion of wealth. His main
    point is that fortunes such as his are only in trust, to be
    disbursed for the public good. Of course, he is the person to decide
    what the public should have: parks, works of art, public
    institutions, and other benefits in the forms best calculated to do
    them lasting good.

## Richard Feynman: The Value of Science

### The Value of Science

- "To every man is given the key to the gates of heaven; the same key
open the gates of hell."

- "For instance, I stand at the seashore, alone, and start to think.
There are the rushing waves ... mountains of molecules, each stupidly
minding its own business ... trillions apart ... yet forming white surf
in unison.
    Ages on ages ... before any eyes could see ... year after year ...
    thunderously pounding the shore as now. For whom, for what?... on a
    dead planet, with no life to entertain.
    Never at rest ... tortured by energy ... wasted prodigiously by the
    sun ... poured into space. A mite makes the sea roar.
    Deep in the sea, all molecules repeat the patterns of one another
    till complex new ones are formed. They make others like themselves
    ... and a new dance starts.
    Growing in size and complexity ... living things, masses of atoms,
    DNA, protein ... dancing a pattern ever more intricate
    Out of the cradle onto the dry land .. here it is standing ...
    atoms with consciousness ... matter with curiosity.
    Stands at the sea ... wonders at wondering ... I ... a universe of
    atoms ... an atom in the universe."
- "The atoms come into my brain, dance a dance, then go out; always new
atoms but always doing the same dance, remembering what the dance was
yesterday."
- "Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of
certainty - some most unsure, some nearly sure, none absolutely
certain."
- "Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that
it is perfectly consistent to be unsure - that it is possible to live
and not know." -> the human beings fear the uncertainty, so they make up
the things and faith and beliefs with certainty, but the scientists are
fine with uncertainty.
- "If we want to solve a problem that we have never solved before, we
must leave the door to the unknown ajar." -> an open channel for future
generation
- "It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress
and great value of a satisfactory philosophy of ignorance, the great
progress that is the fruit of freedom of thought, to proclaim the value
of this freedom, to teach how doubt is not to be feared but welcomed
and discussed, and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming
generations."

## Edward Wilson: What Is Science?

### What Is Science?

- What is science? "It is organized, testable knowledge of the real
world, of everything around us as well as ourselves, as opposed to the
endlessly varied beliefs people hold from myth and superstition. It is
the combination of physical and mental operations that have become
increasingly the habit of educated peoples, a culture of illuminations
dedicated to the most effective way ever conceived of acquiring factual
knowledge."

- "What is the full nature of this phenomenon? What are its causes, its
origin, its consequence?"
    + The opinions, or just logical guesses of these questions are the
    hypotheses.
    + Test the opinions
    + Keep intuiting, guessing, tinkering, testing until solid
    explanations can be put together and a consensus emerges
    + When a phenomenon displays invariable properties under clearly
    defined conditions, then and only then can a scientific explanation
    be declared to be a scientific fact.
    + When research is still incomplete, the idea is a theory. If the
    theory is proved wrong, it was not necessarily also altogether a bad
    theory. At least it will have stimulated new research, which adds to
    knowledge.
- "When a well-defined and precisely consistent process is observed,
the behavior can be precisely measured and mathematically defined as a
law. Laws are more confidently sought in physics and chemistry, where
they can be most easily extended and deepened by mathematical
reasoning."
- Biology ruled by two laws
    + The first is that all entities and processes of life are obedient
    to the laws of physics and chemistry.
    + The second law of biology, more tentative (without confidence)
    than the first, is that all evolution, beyond minor random
    perturbations due to high mutation rates and random fluctuations in
    the number of competing genes, is due to natural selection.
- Science takes nothing away from the genius of the humanities,
including the creative arts. Instead it offers ways to add to their
content.
- The scientific method has been consistently better than religious
beliefs in explaining the origin and meaning of humanity.
- As Freud once remarked, Copernicus demonstrated that Earth is not at
the center of the universe, Darwin that we are not the center of life,
and he, Freud, that we not even in control of our own minds.
- You might then well ask, can a religious believer who accepts one such
story still do good science? Of course he can. But he will be forced to
split his worldview into two domains, one secular (not connected with
or controlled by a church) and the other supernatural, and stay within
the secular domain as he works.
- "We haven't been able to find an explanation for such-and-such a
phenomenon; therefore it must have been created by God." -> the
scientists are the people who seek what really God is.
- "As a scientist, keep your mind open to any possible phenomenon
remaining in the great unknown. But never forget that your profession
is exploration of the real world, with no preconceptions or idols of
the mind accepted, and testable truth the only coin of the realm."
