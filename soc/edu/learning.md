# Overview

- 1) IDENTIFY important concepts, DEFINE the concepts by YOUR OWN
  WORDS, DESCRIBE the concepts by YOUR OWN WORDS
    + keywords, concepts, definitions, equations, formulas, theories,
      theorems, etc.
    + WHATs
- 2) ELABORATE the meaning and REINFORCE it by practice (homework,
  exercises, flash cards)
    + building a whole concept network by connecting with other
      materials
    + building more enduring memories; the more connections the more
      stronger memories
    + WHYs and HOWs
- 3) EVALUATE, EXPLAIN, CREATE
    + HOWs
    + Tests, exam, real problems

```ascii
// (1), (2), (3) interact with each other and reinforce each other
// it becomes a higher learning network

(1) <=====> (2)
 ^           ^
 |==> (3) <==|
```

- WHAT is learning? The definition of learning.
- WHY do we need to learn? The end goal of learning.
- HOW do we learn? Learning how to learn.


# Reasons of ignorance

+ Skewed info
    - Personal bias
    - Outdated facts
    - News bias: sensational, exaggerated
+ Intuition: generalize and jump to conclusion very fast

# Specialization vs Generalization

- Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg are using both methods to have
  a better learning process.
- [Analogy and Analogical Reasoning][2]

# What is learning?

- Learning is a process of gaining new knowledge or modifying existing
  knowledge.
- Humans start the process of learning before birth and continue until
  death.

# Why do we need to learn?

- Learned knowledge vs. innate knowledge
    + Innate knowledge is beneficial when the environment is stable or
      constantly changing.
    + Learned knowledge is beneficial if the change is in a life time
      but it is not constantly changing.
- Why do I need to learn Math and Science? I will never use it in my
  life?
    + You will not use exactly the same math techniques in your life,
      but what you are doing when you learn math and science is you
      develop neural pathways so that you can use it in a surprising
      ways in your life.
    + An analogy is that you go to the gym and lift the weight is to
      develop your muscle so that you can use it to do other things not
      lifting exactly the same weight in the real life.

# How do we learn?

- DISCLAIMER: This is my way of learning. It is effective for me based
  on my research and experience. However, everyone is different, so the
  right way to learn is relative. Thus, everyone needs to find his or
  her own way of learning.

## Factors affecting learning

### External factors

- Heredity: biological traits
- Status: rich vs. poor => physically healthy or not, opportunities
- Physical environment: learning space, classroom vs. open space
    * Create a unique space for learning that you enjoy
    * Only for learning not for anything else (DON'T watch movie there)

### Internal factors

- Goals: specific and clear
    + Immediate goals: TODOs
    + Distant goals: long term
- Motivational behaviors:
    + This behavior arouses and regulates the student's internal
      energies.
    + Spending time in a natural setting:
        * Going for a walk in a park
    + Watching a inspirational movie or documentary
- Interest
- Attention: a mode of the brain
- Attitude: a way of thinking when you counter different situations
- Aptitude (năng khiếu): natural abilities
- Emotional conditions: emotions are physiological states of being.
- Learning activities: practice
- Testing: measure the mastery of knowledge, mastery learning approach
- Guidance: tutoring one-on-one


## Two modes of learning

- Focused mode: attention
    + Using rules and knowledge to solve the problem
    + Working memory: RAM (small storage) => distractions affect your
      productivity
- Diffuse mode: relaxing => gain new insights
    + Spending time to think in a relax way about the problem in a
      natural setting or a comfortable setting.
    + Long-term memory: HDD (practice, mastery learning)
- Going back and forth between two modes is very important.
    + Don't just stay in one mode
- Chunking knowledge by mastering the concepts
    + Each chunk is a compressed knowledge that is mastered by you.
    + The best chunks are the ones that so well ingrained that you don't
      even have to consciously think about connecting neural patterns
      together.
    + Build libraries of chunks, so creativity is sprung from the
      connections between these chunks. (diffuse mode)
    + Chunks in different fields may have similar shape => easier to
      learn (transfer)

## Procrastination

### Over come procrastination

- Physical pain caused by the things that you don't want to do.
- Focus on process instead of product
    + Process: I will work on this 20 minutes, 10 minutes
    + Product: finish 10 questions, finish the essay
- Two approaches
    + Keep working a way through it
        * Just say: "I only do this in ten minutes!"
        * After a few minutes the pain goes away.
    + Pomodoro technique
        * Work at the focus mode in 25 minutes: using timer, turn off
          anything, no notification
        * Don't focus on the task, focus on the time
        * Help you overcome the first painful experience

### Develop a new habit

- The habit can be positive or negative, but they have similar process
  of development
    + Watch for the procrastination cues to change your reactions
- 1. The cue:
    + Time
    + Location
    + How you feel
    + Reactions to other people or something that just happened
- 2. The routine:
    + Create a favorable environment to do what you plan to do
- 3. The reward:
    + Setting a reward for the new habit
    + But no reward if you fail your plan
- 4. The belief/persistent
    + You keep doing what you are doing

## Efficient Learning

### Overview

- How long to go from knowing nothing to being really good at something?
    + 20 hours of learning not including breaks and rests
    + 4 hours / day for a week
    + 1 hours / day for a month (Recommended)
    + 30 minutes / day for two months (The best)
- Create a dedicated place for studying
    + Libraries or some places that make studying easier

### 1. Identifying, Defining, Describing

- Do you really want to learn this new thing?
    + Thinking about pros and cons, emotions, feelings, motivations,
      reasons
    + If you decide to learn it, sign a contract of committing at least
      20 hours to learn this before giving up.
- Pareto principle (80/20): 80% of the effects come from 20% of the
  causes.
    + Determine the most important 20% of the material to learn first
    + Defining and describing your level of performance that you want to
      achieve, the level of mastery that you want to achieve.
- Chunking the material, create small goals and milestones to achieve
- Focusing on one topic at a time, no multitasking
- Create a schedule to study, not cramping, make it consistent
    + Finding 3-4 resources to learn each chunk of knowledge
    + Don't use this step as a way to procrastinate

### 2. Elaborating, Reinforcing

- Create a distraction-free environment for learning
    + Turn off all electronic devices
    + Turn off all notification
    + Sit down at a learning space
    + Make it easier to learn something
        * Put the guitar next to you if you want to learn how to play it
        * Put the book next to you
- Take good notes
    + Go over the notes as soon as possible to solidify the knowledge of
      that lecture
    + Asking for help in office hours
- Homework (learning by doing)
    + Don't just do one, practice, reflect
    + Redo it until you can play it in your head as a song
    + Reflect: Master the concept the homework try to teach you
- Recall
    + Don't just highlight and look at the text => you think that you
      get it. No, you don't!
    + Look at the page, look away, and try to recall everything
- Understanding alone is not enough to master the material
    + It needs to combine with Practice and Repetition in a variety of
      circumstances

### 3. Evaluating, Reflecting, Debriefing

- Tests
    + Test yourself everything, and all the time by using flash cards
    + Don't look at the solution and just try to recall everything
    + Using flash cards
    + Practice Exams
- Explain things in a simple manner so that a 10 years old can
  understand it. (Feynman's technique)
    + On a piece of paper, write down the concept that you want to
      explain in a title.
    + Trying to explain the concept using simple language
        * a simple definition
        * a few examples with diagrams, graphs
        * working out all steps
    + If you are struggle to explain it in a simple manner, go back to
      the source material to review the concept, practice with problems
      to master it.
        * Try to derive the concept by yourself
    + Simplify your language even further, as much as you can

## Getting help from others

- What is it that I don't understand?
    + Can I define and describe it?
    + I understand this and that but not the next step.
    + Pinpoint what you don't understand

## Sleeping

- Short periods of learning + sleep in between
- Napping at noon: 15 - 30 minutes
- Get sleep at night: 7 - 8 hours

## Working out - Exercise

- Running, walking, swimming
- Martial arts, sports

## Learning a new language

### Principles

- Focus on language content that relevant to you.
    + Daily life
    + EECS
- Using the new language that you learned to communicate from day 1.
- Unconscious Comprehension: physiological training
    + Hear the sound
    + Practicing speaking
- Pscho-physiological states matter
    + Happy, relaxed, don't be stressed

### Actions

- Listen a lot
    + rhythms, pattern
- Getting the meaning even before the words
    + body language
- Start mixing
    + it doesn't need to be perfect
    + just combined all the words that you learned to convey the meaning
- Basic phrases that you need at first
    + What is this?
    + How do you day?
    + I don't understand ...
- Pronouns, common verbs, adjectives
- Glue words: and, but,
- Get a language parent
    + who interested in you, respected you
    + who will communicate as equal
    + create a safe environment for you to practice
    + Language parent rules
        * Works to understand what you are saying
        * Does not correct mistakes
        * Confirms understanding by using correct language
        * Use words the learner knows

# Collective intelligence - Teams

- Factors of a collective intelligence
    + Individual quality
        * Production technologies
    + Connection quality
        * Diversity (majority is female)
        * Social intelligence
        * Equality of contribution (not only one person that does
          everything)
        * Coordination technologies: enhance communication
- Technologies
    + Tool
        * Humans remain in charge, use tool to assist in way they do
        work (Skype, git, spreadsheets, word processors, etc.)
    + Assistant
        * Takes initiative, anticipates what humans might search for or
        reminds them of things (Siri, Google Assistant, etc.)
    + Manager
        * System organizes work and directs or evaluates the work of
        humans (FoldIt, Google Maps, Autonomous Driving)

# Fun facts

- Students in senior year of high schools in Korea can spend 13 hours
  per day for studying, and they only sleep for about five hours.


# Tips and Tricks

## Interleaving

- Building flexibility and creativity
- Working with problems of different types, different types of
  approaches, concepts, procedures.
- Expertise in different fields

## How to plan and make to-do lists

- Making daily to-do list every evening before going to bed
    + Don't make it too many tasks: 4-6 tasks per day
    + Estimate how may short session that each task needs: 2 * 25
      minutes sessions
- Use Pomodoro technique to focus on processes instead of products
  (goals) when you choose to work on a task.
- Work on the most important and the most disliked task first at the
  beginning of the day.

## Getting Intense focus in a short session of studying

- Choose only one task to complete
- Don't distract yourself by eating, entertainment
- Make sure the tools to work on the task are ready
- Timers if you don't have any deadline
- Work alone
- Recovery: relaxing, not too much
    + Eating and watching YouTube, reading Manga

## Tips for multiple choices

- Don't go through question in a linear fashion. Take a few minutes to
  go through and skim the test to get the general overview of the
  questions.
    + Answer any question that you can right away
- Start with the hard question for few minutes
    + Solve it if you can
    + If not move on to the easier questions
    + Why: hard questions = focused mode; easy questions = diffused mode
      => the hard questions are working in the background
- Read each question twice carefully
    + It's tricky and sneaky
- Recheck questions after finish each page of the test
- Stuck with a hard question: envision the area where you learned that
  knowledge
- If you have to guess the answer
    + True is more likely than False
    + 3 options: A, B, C => just choose one, no bias
    + 4 options: A, B, C, D => B
    + 5 options: A, B, C, D, E => E
    + All of the above/None of the above: if you can't narrow it down

## Flashcards

### Making your own flashcards

- Add pictures and mix them with words
    + Mnemonic devices: anything that helps you create a mental
      association between two pieces of information
        * ROYGBIV: order of colors in the visible light spectrum
        * Associative imagery: weird crazy stories
- One card, one question/one fact; don't cramp many facts in one card
    + Illusion of competence: recognition vs. recall
        * Recognition: I've exposed/seen this before
        * Recall: Actively retrieving something out of memory without
    + If you know only some of the facts in a multiple fact flashcard,
      you are caught in the illusion of competence that you know all the
      facts.
- Break down complex concepts into multiple simple questions

### Studying the cards

- Say the answers out loud
    + A way of mentally committing to your answers before looking at the
      solution.
    + Avoid the illusion of competence
- Study the card in both directions
    + From the question to the answer, and vice versa
    + From the symbol to the definition, and vice versa

### Spaced Repetition Technique

- Divide the cards into categories
    + Study every day
    + Study every other day
    + Once per week
    + Once per two weeks
    + Review before test
- If you get the right answer of the card (both sides), the card
  graduates to the next category.
    + If you get it wrong, the card goes straight to the first category,
      study every day.

## More effective in lectures

- If the speed of the professor is faster than what you want
    + Preparing before the lecture
        * Read the notes, textbooks
    + Switching to webcast instead of live lectures
    + Choose a good location to sit

## Making connections

+ Taking notes instead of typing
    - Using MIND MAPPING again
    - Practice how to do MIND MAPs
+ Saying words out loud
+ Your emotions
+ Your memories
+ Another subjects

## Learning new languages

- Space repetition software (SRS)
- Japanese
    + WaniKani
    + AnkiSRS.net
- Method of Loci
    + Associate words with different rooms of the house
    + Visualization association
- Rewarding systems
    + Watching an episode
    + Reading a chapter of Manga

## Others

1. Halo effect - professors impression of you ( eye contact, note taking, sit in front)
2. Plan like you’ve never planned before (calendars, syllabus, highlight)
3. Know game plan - components of each class (grading scale) ask upper class men for advice
4. Surround self with smart, accountable friends
5. Make projects mean something ( invest time in)
6. Send assignments early to professors ( they will tell you what you did wrong)
7. Be meticulous (perfection)
8. Be efficient (each class requires different strategic study plans)
9. Know your limits (make plan according to your preference)
10. Eliminate distractions and say no to Netflix
11. Study to UNDERSTAND!!! (teach yourself)
12. Change game plan to each class
13. Prepare for crunch time (practice problems and exams) (ready to go) ( diy study guide)
14. “Do more than what was asked” “be extra” take resources you have and utilize them
