    + keywords, concepts, definitions, equations, formulas, theories,
      theorems, etc.
    + WHATs
- 2) Elaborating meaning, Reinforcement
    + building a whole concept network based on the essence of things
    + building more enduring memories; the more connections the more
      stronger memories
    + WHYs and HOWs
- 3) Evaluating, Explaining, Creating
    + HOWs

```ascii
// (1), (2), (3) interact with each other and reinforce each other
// it becomes a higher learning network

(1) <=====> (2)
 ^           ^
 |==> (3) <==|
```

# What is learning?

# Why do we need to learn?

# How do we learn?

- DISCLAIMER: This is my way of learning. It is effective for me based
on my research and experience. However, everyone is different, so the
right way to learn is relative. Thus, everyone needs to find his or her
own way of learning.

    - Outdated facts
    - News bias: sensational, exaggerated
+ Intuition: generalize and jump to conclusion very fast
