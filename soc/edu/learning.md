# Overview

- 1) IDENTIFY important concepts, DEFINE the concepts by YOUR OWN
  WORDS, DESCRIBE the concepts by YOUR OWN WORDS
    + keywords, concepts, definitions, equations, formulas, theories,
      theorems, etc.
    + WHATs
- 2) ELABORATE the meaning and REINFORCE it by practice (homework,
  exercises, flash cards)
    + building a whole concept network by connecting with other
      materials
    + building more enduring memories; the more connections the more
      stronger memories
    + WHYs and HOWs
- 3) EVALUATE, EXPLAIN, CREATE
    + HOWs
    + Tests, exam, real problems

```ascii
// (1), (2), (3) interact with each other and reinforce each other
// it becomes a higher learning network

(1) <=====> (2)
 ^           ^
 |==> (3) <==|
```

- WHAT is learning? The definition of learning.
- WHY do we need to learn? The end goal of learning.
- HOW do we learn? Learning how to learn.

# Specialization vs Generalization

- Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg are using both methods to have
  a better learning process.

# What is learning?

# Why do we need to learn?

# How do we learn?

- DISCLAIMER: This is my way of learning. It is effective for me based
on my research and experience. However, everyone is different, so the
right way to learn is relative. Thus, everyone needs to find his or her
own way of learning.

+ Skewed info
    - Personal bias
    - Outdated facts
    - News bias: sensational, exaggerated
+ Intuition: generalize and jump to conclusion very fast
