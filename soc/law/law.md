# Overview

# Terminologies

## Warrant

- A warrant is an official legal order, usually signed by a judge or
  magistrate, that authorizes a specific action by law enforcement, such
  as making an arrest or conducting a search.
- They are a key part of the judicial system, ensuring that actions like
  arrests and searches are conducted with legal oversight and probable
  cause, protecting individual rights from unreasonable searches and
  seizures.
- There are several types of warrants, including arrest warrants for
  taking a person into custody and search warrants for searching a
  specific location for evidence.
- Common types of warrants
    + Arrest Warrant: A court order that authorizes a police officer to arrest a person suspected of committing a crime.
    + Search Warrant: A court order that authorizes law enforcement to search a specific location, such as a house or vehicle, for evidence of a crime.
    + Bench Warrant: A warrant issued by a judge for the arrest of a person who has failed to appear in court or has been found in contempt of court.

## Bail

- Bail is money or property given to the court to guarantee a
  defendant's appearance at future court dates.
- This payment ensures the person returns for their trial, and if they
  do, the bail is refunded at the end of the case.
- If they fail to appear or violate other conditions, the court keeps
  the money or property.

## Bail Bond

- A bail bond is a financial agreement through a third-party bail
  bondsman that allows a person to be released from jail before their
  trial.
- The defendant pays a non-refundable fee, typically 10% of the total
  bail amount, and the bondsman pays the full bail to the court,
  guaranteeing the defendant's appearance.
- If the defendant fails to appear, the bondsman is liable for the full
  bail amount. The bondsman may then use the collateral to pay the court
  and hire a bounty hunter to find and return the defendant to custody.

# Common Situations

## Who and When someone can enter your home without your consent?

Generally they need search warrant to enter your home except
emergencies.

### Law Enforcement

- Emergency (Exigent Circumstances)	If officers have a reasonable belief that someone inside is in immediate danger, evidence is about to be destroyed, or a suspect will escape, they can enter without a warrant.
- Hot Pursuit	If police are actively chasing a felony suspect and see them enter your home, they can follow them inside.
- Plain View	If officers are lawfully at your door for any reason (e.g., a noise complaint) and see illegal items or evidence inside, they can legally enter and seize it.
- Valid Arrest Warrant	If police have an arrest warrant for someone they have reason to believe is inside your home, they can enter to make the arrest. Any evidence in "plain view" during the arrest can be seized.
- Parole or Probation	If you have an occupant who is on probation or parole with a search condition, officers may enter the residence to conduct a search under those terms.

### Landlords

- Emergencies	Landlords can enter immediately without notice for emergencies like a fire, gas leak, or severe flooding.
- Court Order	A landlord can enter if they have a court order.
- Reasonable Notice	For non-emergencies, such as repairs, inspections, or showing the property to prospective tenants, they must provide reasonable advance notice, which varies by state (e.g., 24 to 48 hours).
- Lease Agreement	The specific terms and notice period for entry are often outlined in the lease. State law, however, will always override any illegal provisions in a lease.

### Child Protective Service (CPS)

- Imminent Danger: If a caseworker has reason to believe a child is in immediate danger of abuse, neglect, or serious harm, they can enter without a court order.
- Search Warrant or Court Order: If you refuse a CPS caseworker entry, they may seek a court order or search warrant. You must comply once a warrant is produced.

### Others

- Emergency responders: during a fire or medical call
- Bail bond agents: need warrants
