### Run-ons

A run-on occurs when two sentences are run together with no adequate
sign given to mark the break between them.

#### What are Run-ons?

- Fused sentences: without punctuation
    + My grades are very good this semester my social life rates only a
      C.
- Comma splices: a comma is used to connect, or "splice" together, the
two complete thoughts.
    + My grades are very good this semester, my social life rates only a
      C.

#### Correcting Run-ons

1. Use a period and a capital letter to break the two complete thoughts
into separate sentences.
    - My grades are very good this semester. My social life rates only a
      C.
2. Use a comma plus a joining word (a coordinating conjunction -
FANBOYS) to connect the two complete thoughts.
    - My grades are very good this semester, but my social life rates
       only a C.
3. Use a semicolon (colon, dash) to connect the two complete thoughts.
    - My grades are very good this semester; my social life rates only
       a C.
4. Use subordination.
    - Although my grades are very good this semester, my social life
       rates only a C.
5. Use a semicolon (colon, dash) and a transitional word or phrase
   (however, in fact).
    - Officials at many elementary schools are trying to reduce
      childhood obesity on their campuses; however, research suggests
      that few of their strategies will work.

#### A good sentence without run-on

Knowing that millions of people around the world would be watching in
person and on television and expecting great things from him - at least
one more gold medal for America, if not another world record - during
this, his fourth and surely his last appearance in the World Olympics,
and realizing that his legs could no longer carry him down the runway
with the same blazing speed and confidence in making a huge, eye-popping
leap that they were capable of a few years ago when he set world records
in the 100-meter dash and in the 400-meter relay and won a silver medal
in the long jump, the renowned sprinter and track-and field personality
Carl Lewis, who had known pressure from fans and media before but never,
even as a professional runner, this king of pressure, made only a few
appearances in races during the few months before the summer Olympics in
Atlanta, Georgia, partly because he was afraid of raising expectations
even higher and he did not want to be distracted by interviews and
adoring fans who would follow him into stores and restaurants demanding
autographs and photo-opportunities, but mostly because he wanted to
conserve his energies and concentrate, like a martial arts expert, on
the job at hand: winning his favorite competition, the long ump, and
bringing home another Gold Medal for the United States, the most fitting
conclusion to his brilliant career in track and field.

## Position of `sometimes`

IMHO, meaning of your sentence depends on where you put the word
"sometimes". Wherever you put it, it'll emphasise the words following
it. I would interpret it as follows:

- **SOMETIMES it's good to go to the church** or **It's SOMETIMES good
  to go to the church** [implies a continuation like "...rather than
  stay in bed until noon"; here "SOMETIMES" relates to "good to go"].
  (`This is more common`)

- "It's good to go SOMETIMES to the church" ["...and sometimes to the
  mosque", here "SOMETIMES" refers to "the church"].

- "It's good to go to the church SOMETIMES" ["... but not too often",
  "SOMETIMES" acts on its own]

**Some examples**

```
I [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] like to answer questions about adverbs.
I have [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] liked to answer questions about adverbs.
I can [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
I am [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.
```

You can add sometimes to any of the four lists above, but not to any of
the four below.

```
I do not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
I have not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answered questions about adverbs.
I can't [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
I am not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.
```

You can place sometimes at the beginning of any of the eight examples
above.
