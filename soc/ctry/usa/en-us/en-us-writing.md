# Fundamentals of Effective Writings

## An Introduction to Writing

### What?

Writing consists basically of making a point and then providing evidence
to support or develop that point.
+ What is your point?
+ What is your support for that point?

Four basic principles:
1. **Unity**: start with a clearly stated point.
2. **Support**: provide logical, detailed support for your point.
3. **Coherence**: organize and connect your supporting material.
4. **Sentence Skills**: revise and edit so that your sentences are
   effective and error-free.

### Why?

Benefits of Paragraph Writing
- Mastering the structure of paragraphs will make me a better writer.
- Writing paragraphs strengthens my skills as a reader and listener.
  I'll become more aware of the ideas of other writers and speakers and
  the evidence they provide - or fail to provide - to support those
  ideas.
- Paragraph writing will make me a stronger thinker. Traditional
  paragraph writing will train my mind to think clearly.

When I write for others, it is crucial to know both my purpose for
writing and the audience who will be reading my work.
- Purpose (Why?)
    + To **inform**: to give information about a subject. Authors
      writing to inform want to provide facts that will explain or teach
      something to readers. For example, an informative paragraph about
      sandwiches might begin, "Eating food between two slices of bread -
      a sandwich - is a practice that has its origins in eighteenth-
      century England."
        * To describe
            - Describe the physical appearance and body language of a
              trial witness
        * To explain (process)
            - Explain how to change the ink in a printer.
    + To **persuade**: to convince the reader to agree with the author's
      point of view on a subject. Authors writing to persuade may give
      facts, but their main goal is to argue or prove a point to
      readers. A persuasive paragraph about sandwiches might begin,
      "There are good reasons why every sandwich should be made with
      whole grain bread."
    + To **entertain**: to amuse and delight; to appeal to the reader's
      senses and imagination. Authors write to entertain in various
      ways, through fiction and nonfiction. An entertaining paragraph
      about sandwiches might begin, "What I wanted was a midnight snack,
      but what I got was better - the biggest, most magical sandwich in
      the entire world."
        * Create a story that conveys an important theme about
          environmental conservation.
- Audience (Who?)
    + Is the audience an individual or a group? Is the group specific or
      general?
    + What are the demographic features (age, gender, socioeconomic
      status, religion, politics, education, etc.) of the audience?
    + Why might the reader need or want to read this material?
    + How much does the audience already know about the subject?
    (required knowledge)
        * If I assume that my readers know very little, I might bore
          them with too much basic information. But, if I assume that
          they know more than they do, you might confuse them by using
          unfamiliar technical terminology or neglecting to provide
          enough informative detail.
    + Is my purpose simply to inform the audience? Or is it to convince
      readers of something as well?
    + What type of language should be used? relaxed, friendly, and
      informal or more formal.

### How?

Writing as a skill, competent writing comes only from plain hard work -
determination and sweat.

Writing as a process of discovery
- As you write, you may suddenly switch direction or double back.
- Writers frequently do not know their exact destination as they begin
  to write.

Keeping a daily or almost daily Journal
- Writing a journal will help me develop the habit of thinking on paper
  and will show me how ideas can be discovered in the process of writing
- A journal can make writing a familiar part of my life and can serve as
  a continuing source of ideas for papers.

### Goals

1. If you make one point and stick to that point, your writing will have
   unity.
2. If you back up the point with specific evidence, your writing will
   have support.
3. If you organize and connect the specific evidence, your writing will
   have coherence.
4. If you write clear, error-free sentences, your writing will
   demonstrate effective sentence skills.

### Process

1. Discovering a point - often through prewriting.
2. Developing solid support for the point - often through more
   prewriting.
3. organizing the supporting material and writing it out in a first
   draft.
4. Revising and then editing carefully to ensure an effective, error-
   free paper.


### Prewriting

#### Freewriting

You write on your topic for ten minutes.
- Do not worry about spelling or punctuating correctly, about erasing
  mistakes, about organizing material, or about finding exact words.
- You just write without stopping. If you get stuck for words, you write
  "I am looking for something to say" or repeat words until you think of
  something.

#### Questioning

You generate ideas and details by asking as many questions as you can
think of about your subject. Such question include Why? When? Where?
Who? How? In what ways?

#### Clustering

Clustering, also known as diagramming or mapping. Using lines, boxes,
arrows, and circles to show relationships among the ideas and details.

### Scratch Outline

Point(Topic Sentence): ...
Supports(Statement Sentences):
Statement Sentence 1.
    Concrete Detail 1.
    Commentary 1. (your intellectual comments)
SS2.
    CD2.
    CM2.
SS3.
    CD3.
    CM3.

### Writing a First Draft

- Follow you scratch outline.
- Do not worry yet about grammar, punctuation, or spelling.
- New details and ideas may pop into you mind, just add the new
  information.

### Revising

Rewrite your paragraph, building upon what has already been done, in
order to make it stronger.
- First: set your first draft aside for a while. You can then come back
  to it with a fresher, more objective point of view.
- Second: work with printed, double-spaced text.
- Third: read your draft aloud
- Four: write additional thoughts and changes above the lines or in the
  margins of your paragraph.

#### Revising Content

1. Is my paragraph **unified**?
2. Is my paragraph **supported**?
3. Is my paragraph **organized**?
    - Do I use transitions and other connecting words?

#### Revising Sentences

1. Do I use **parallelism** to balance my words and ideas?
2. Do I have a **consistent point of view**?
3. Do I use **specific** words?
4. Do I use **active** verbs?
5. Do I use words effectively by **avoiding slang, cliches, pretentious
   language**, and **wordiness**?
6. Do I **vary my sentences** in length and structure?

### Editing

Checking a paragraph for mistakes in grammar, punctuation, usage, and
spelling.

### Using Peer Review

- Read partner's paragraph aloud.
- Check or circle the trouble spots.
- Make a scratch outline.

## Point and Supporting the point

### Begin with a point


### Support the point with specific evidence


## Writing in the Digital Age

- Each file contain all stages of the writing process:
    + Prewriting: dim the screen of the monitor so that you can't see
      what you're typing. You won't have to worry about grammar or
      spelling or typing errors; instead, you can concentrate on getting
      down as many ideas and details possible about your subject.
    + Scratch Outline: at any point in the prewriting, outlining you
      might want to do some Google searches to get ideas.
    + First Draft
    + Revising
    + Editing and proofreading

Turn off any notification and turn on the full screen mode when writing.

The Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C., has copies of all books
published in the United States. You can visit at [www.loc.gov][1]

### Evaluating Internet Sources

- Author
    + What credentials does the author have?
    + What academic degrees does he or she hold?
    + Does the author work for a college, university, well-respected
      think tank, or research group?
    + Has he or she published other material on the topic?
- Internal evidence
    + Does the author seem to proceed objectively - presenting all sides
      of the issue fairly before stating his or her own views?
    + Does the **sponsor** of the Web site seem to be an objective
      source?
    + Does the author provide adequate support for his or her views?
    + Was the article first published in a print version?
- Date
    + Is the information up to date?

## How to write the introduction

### Thesis Statement

- https://www.kibin.com/essay-writing-blog/thesis-statement-examples/

- Topic: debatable
- Position (Stance): agree/disagree
- Reason/Evidence (3 points)

## How to write the conclusion

[Strategies for Writing a Conclusion][strategies-for-writing-a-conclusion]

A writer needs to keep in mind that the conclusion is often what a
reader remembers best. Your conclusion should be the best part of your
paper.

### A conclusion should

- stress the important of the thesis statement,
- give the essay a sense of completeness, and
- leave a final impression on the reader.

### The way to get the ideas

- Answer the question "So What?"
    + Show your readers why this paper was important. Show them that
      your paper was meaningful and useful.
- Synthesize, don't summarize
    + Don't simply repeat things that were in your paper. They have read
    it. Show them how the points you made and the support and examples
    you used were not random, but fit together.
- Redirect your readers
    + Give your reader something to think about, perhaps a way to use
    your paper in the "real" world. Think globally.
- Create a new meaning
    + You don't have to give new information to create a new meaning. By
    demonstrating how your ideas work together, you can create a new
    picture.

### Strategies

#### Echoing the introduction

#### Challenging the reader

#### Looking to the future

#### Posing questions

# Sentence skills

## Grammar

### Run-ons

A run-on occurs when two sentences are run together with no adequate
sign given to mark the break between them.

#### What are Run-ons?

- Fused sentences: without punctuation
    + My grades are very good this semester my social life rates only a
      C.
- Comma splices: a comma is used to connect, or "splice" together, the
two complete thoughts.
    + My grades are very good this semester, my social life rates only a
      C.

#### Correcting Run-ons

1. Use a period and a capital letter to break the two complete thoughts
into separate sentences.
    - My grades are very good this semester. My social life rates only a
      C.
2. Use a comma plus a joining word (a coordinating conjunction -
FANBOYS) to connect the two complete thoughts.
    - My grades are very good this semester, but my social life rates
       only a C.
3. Use a semicolon (colon, dash) to connect the two complete thoughts.
    - My grades are very good this semester; my social life rates only
       a C.
4. Use subordination.
    - Although my grades are very good this semester, my social life
       rates only a C.
5. Use a semicolon (colon, dash) and a transitional word or phrase
   (however, in fact).
    - Officials at many elementary schools are trying to reduce
      childhood obesity on their campuses; however, research suggests
      that few of their strategies will work.

#### A good sentence without run-on

Knowing that millions of people around the world would be watching in
person and on television and expecting great things from him - at least
one more gold medal for America, if not another world record - during
this, his fourth and surely his last appearance in the World Olympics,
and realizing that his legs could no longer carry him down the runway
with the same blazing speed and confidence in making a huge, eye-popping
leap that they were capable of a few years ago when he set world records
in the 100-meter dash and in the 400-meter relay and won a silver medal
in the long jump, the renowned sprinter and track-and field personality
Carl Lewis, who had known pressure from fans and media before but never,
even as a professional runner, this king of pressure, made only a few
appearances in races during the few months before the summer Olympics in
Atlanta, Georgia, partly because he was afraid of raising expectations
even higher and he did not want to be distracted by interviews and
adoring fans who would follow him into stores and restaurants demanding
autographs and photo-opportunities, but mostly because he wanted to
conserve his energies and concentrate, like a martial arts expert, on
the job at hand: winning his favorite competition, the long ump, and
bringing home another Gold Medal for the United States, the most fitting
conclusion to his brilliant career in track and field.

## Mechanics

## Punctuation

## Word use

# [Plagiarism][plagiarism]

# Write an email - email etiquette

## Format

- Greeting
- Who you are?
- Your reason for writing
- Closing
- Signature

## Rules

### Greeting

- Starting email with: `Dear`, `Hello`, `Hi`
- Using first name in regular workplace, some upper-level prefer `Mr.`
  or `Ms.`, using `Dr.` for a medical doctor or professor for the first
  time. If you don't have a specific name for the recipient, a simple
  `Hello` is perfectly sufficient.

### Closing

- `Best`: easy to use
- `Best regards`: This phrase is professional, but with some warmth.
  It's common for business emails that are less formal, such as between
  co-workers who work together somewhat frequently. This can be
  shortened further to `Regards` when emailing someone familiar.
- `Sincerely`: This is a universal closing sentiment and appropriate in
  most situations, little bit old-fashion.
- `Thanks`, `Thanks so much`, `Many thanks`: more familiar
- `Thank you`, `Thank you so much`: more formal
- `Respectfully`: This is a formal sendoff that's appropriate when
  emailing the CEO, Chairman of the Board, or a high-level company
  executive.
- `Fondly`: This is definitely a social closing, not a professional one,
  a level of familiarity.
- `Warm regards`: This is a more formal version of `fondly`, but it's
  still best suited for social emails.
- `Hope this helps`

### Signature

Make sure your signature line lists the basics: your full name, title,
company name, and contact information, including phone numbers and
email.

## Write an email to a professor for a recommendation

[How](http://www.wikihow.com/Email-a-Professor)

### Example

```
Dear Professor XXX,

I am a student at XXX College with a major in xxx.  I am a junior and
will be graduating next May.  I have a 4.0 GPA and experience in our
college’s summer program in xxx.

I am planning to attend graduate school in xxx, with a focus on xxx.  In
one of my classes, “xxx,” which was taught by Professor XXX, I had the
chance to read your article, “xxxx.”  I really enjoyed it, and it gave
me many ideas for my future research.  I have been exploring graduate
programs where I can work on this topic.

I hope you don’t mind my getting in touch, but I’d like to inquire
whether you are currently accepting graduate students.  And if you are,
if you’d be willing to talk to me a bit more, by email or on the phone,
or in person if I can arrange a campus visit, about my graduate school
plans.  I have explored your department’s graduate school website in
detail, and it seems like an excellent fit for me because of its
emphasis on xx and xx,  but I still have a few specific questions about
xx and xxx that I’d like to talk to you about.

I know you’re very busy so I appreciate any time you can give me.
Thanks very much,

Sincerely,

XX XXX

Dr. XXXXXX,

I hope your summer is off to a good start. This is just a brief reminder
that the Pre-medical Committee office asks that letters of
recommendation for medical school applicants be submitted as close to
June 1 as possible. The application verification process began today and
AMCAS will begin sending information to individual schools within a
couple of weeks. It is best if all of my letters are included in this
initial submission, as that will minimize delays in the review process.

If you need another copy of my personal statement or other pertinent
documents I would be happy to send them to you.

Once again, thank you so much for your help and support. It truly means
a great deal to me. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for
you.

| two-faced              | not honest or sincere. Will say one thing to someone to their face and another when they are not present |


## Position of `sometimes`

IMHO, meaning of your sentence depends on where you put the word
"sometimes". Wherever you put it, it'll emphasise the words following
it. I would interpret it as follows:

- **SOMETIMES it's good to go to the church** or **It's SOMETIMES good
  to go to the church** [implies a continuation like "...rather than
  stay in bed until noon"; here "SOMETIMES" relates to "good to go"].
  (`This is more common`)

- "It's good to go SOMETIMES to the church" ["...and sometimes to the
  mosque", here "SOMETIMES" refers to "the church"].

- "It's good to go to the church SOMETIMES" ["... but not too often",
  "SOMETIMES" acts on its own]

**Some examples**

```
I [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] like to answer questions about adverbs.
I have [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] liked to answer questions about adverbs.
I can [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
I am [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.
```

You can add sometimes to any of the four lists above, but not to any of
the four below.

```
I do not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
I have not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answered questions about adverbs.
I can't [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
I am not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.
```

You can place sometimes at the beginning of any of the eight examples
above.
