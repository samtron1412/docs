# Evolving interpretations of the term jianghu (江湖 - rivers and lakes）

- It is used to describe the martial arts world of ancient China
- First coined by Zhuangzi in the late 4th century BC: it was used to
  describe a way of life different from that of being actively involved
  in politics. At the time, it referred to the way of life of
  underachieving of maligned scholar-officials who distanced themselves
  from the circles of political power. In this sense, jianghu could be
  loosely interpreted as the way of life of a hermit.
- Over the centuries, jianghu gained acceptance among the common people
  and gradually became a term used to describe a sub-society parallel to
  mainstream society. This sub-society initially included merchants,
  craftsmen, beggars and vagabonds, but over time it assimilated
  bandits, outlaws and gangs who lived “outside the existing law”.
  During the Song and Yuan (900-1368) dynaties, bards and novelists
  began using the term jianghu to create a liturature of a fictional
  society of adventurers and rebels who lived not by existing laws, but
  by their own moral principles.
- The moral principles are xia (俠；侠；chivalry), yi (義； 义；righteousness),
  li (禮；礼；virtue), zhong (忠；loyalty) and chou (仇；vengeance/revenge).
- The inclusion of martial arts as a feature of jianghu was a recent
  development in the early 20th century. Novelists started creating a
  fantasy world in jianghu in which characters are martial artists and
  in which the characters’ enforcement of righteousness is symbolized by
  conflicts between different martial artists or martial arts sects and
  the ultimate triumph of good over evil. Martial arts became a tool
  used by characters in a jianghu story to enforce their moral beliefs.
  On the other hand, there are characters who become corrupted by power
  derived from their formidable prowess in martial arts and end up
  abandoning their morality in their pursuit of power. Around this time,
  the term jianghu became closely related to a similar term, wulin
  (武林；martial forest). A leader, called the “wulin mengzhu” (武林盟主；master
  of the wulin alliance)

# The basic norms (spoken and unspoken) of the jianghu:

2. Personal feuds do not extend to family members.
3. Always show respect for seniors and elders
4. Complete obedience to one’s shifu
5. No learning of martial arts from another person without prior permission from one’s shifu
6. No using of martial arts against those who are not trained in martial arts.

8. No sexual relationships with the wives of friends
