# Type system
In programming languages, a type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called a *type* to the various constructs - such as variables, expressions, functions or modules - a computer program is composed of.

The main purpose of a type system is to reduce bugs in computer programs by defining interfaces between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that the parts have been connected in a consistent way.

This checking can happen statically (at compile time), dynamically (at run time), or it can happen as a combination of static and dynamic checking.

## Duck typing
not check have method in class, just run and throw error in run time.
