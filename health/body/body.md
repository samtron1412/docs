### What Is Rhinitis?

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinitis

The word rhinitis means “inflammation of the nose.” The nose produces
fluid called mucus. This fluid is normally thin and clear. It helps to
keep dust, debris and allergens out of the lungs. Mucus traps particles
like dust and pollen, as well as bacteria and viruses.

Mucus usually drains down the back of your throat. You’re not aware of
this most of the time because it is a small amount and is thin. When the
nose becomes irritated, it may produce more mucus, which becomes thick
and pale yellow. The mucus may begin to flow from the front of the nose
as well as the back. Substances in the mucus may irritate the back of
the throat and cause coughing. Postnasal drip occurs when more mucus
drains down the back of the throat.

### What Causes Rhinitis?

Irritants or allergens (substances that provoke an allergic response)
may cause rhinitis. The cells of your body react to these irritants or
allergens by releasing histamine and other chemicals. Rhinitis is often
a temporary condition. It clears up on its own after a few days for many
people. In others, especially those with allergies, rhinitis can be a
chronic problem. Chronic means it is almost always present or recurs
often. Rhinitis can last for weeks to months with allergen exposure.

### What Are the Types of Rhinitis?

There are several types of rhinitis:

- Allergic rhinitis is caused by allergies to substances called
allergens.
- Seasonal allergic rhinitis is sometimes called “hay fever.” But,
  people with seasonal allergic rhinitis do not have to have a fever and
  do not have to be exposed to hay to develop this condition. It is an
  allergic reaction to pollen from trees, grasses and weeds. This type
  of rhinitis occurs mainly in the spring and fall, when pollen from
  trees, grasses and weeds are in the air.
- Perennial allergic rhinitis is caused by allergens that are present
  all year long. The primary causes of this type of rhinitis are
  allergies to dust mites, mold, animal dander and cockroach debris.
- Non-allergic rhinitis is not caused by allergens. Smoke, chemicals or
  other irritating environmental conditions may provoke non-allergic
  rhinitis. Hormonal changes, physical defects of the nose (like a
  deviated septum) and the overuse of nose sprays may also cause it.
  Sometimes medications cause it. Often, the cause of this type of
  rhinitis is not well understood. But it is common in patients with
  non-allergic asthma. The symptoms are similar to allergy symptoms.
- Infectious rhinitis is possibly the most common type of rhinitis. It
  is also known as the common cold or upper respiratory infection (URI).
  Colds occur when a cold virus settles into the mucous membranes of the
  nose and sinus cavities and causes an infection. What Are the Symptoms
  of Rhinitis?

### Rhinitis symptoms include:

- Itching in the nose and eyes
- Sneezing
- Stuffy nose (congestion)
- Runny nose
- Mucus (phlegm) in the throat (postnasal drip)

### Is It Allergies or a Cold?

Sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference between allergies and
the common cold. There are more than a hundred strains of cold viruses.
Each tends to become widespread at certain times of the year, which is
why you may mistake a cold for a seasonal allergy. Allergies occur at
the same time every year and last as long as the allergen is in the air
(usually 2-3 weeks per allergen). Allergies cause itching of the nose
and eyes along with other nasal symptoms. Colds last about one week and
have less itching of the nose and eyes.

### What Are the Treatments for Allergic Rhinitis?

The first and best option is to avoid contact with substances that
trigger your nasal allergies (allergens). When prevention is not enough,
consider using over-the-counter or prescription medicines:

- Antihistamines are taken by mouth or as a nasal spray. They can
  relieve sneezing and itching in the nose and eyes. They also reduce a
  runny nose and, to a lesser extent, nasal stuffiness.
- Decongestants are taken by mouth or as a nasal spray or drops. They
  help shrink the lining of the nasal passages which relieves nasal
  stuffiness. These nose drops and sprays should be taken short-term.
- Nasal corticosteroids are used in nasal spray form. They reduce
  inflammation in the nose and block allergic reactions. They are the
  most effective medicine type for allergic rhinitis because they can
  reduce all symptoms, including nasal congestion. Nasal corticosteroids
  have few side effects.
- Leukotriene receptor antagonists block the action of important
  chemical messengers other than histamine that are involved in allergic
  reactions.
- Cromolyn sodium is a nasal spray that blocks the release of chemicals
  that cause allergy symptoms, including histamine and leukotrienes.
  This medicine has few side effects, but you must take it four times a
  day.
- Nasal allergy symptoms may disappear completely when the allergen is
  removed or after the allergy is treated. Talk to your pharmacist and
  health care provider about what is best for you.

Many people with allergies do not get complete relief from medications.
They may be candidates for immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is a long-term
treatment that can help prevent or reduce the severity of allergic
reactions and change the course of allergic disease by modifying the
body’s immune response to allergens.

### How Can I Prevent Allergic Rhinitis?

The first and best option is to avoid contact with allergens. Other
prevention tips are:

- Don’t touch or rub your nose.
- Wash your hands often with soap and water.
- Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to reduce allergen exposure while
  vacuuming.
- Wash your bed linens and pillowcases in hot water and detergent to
  reduce allergens.
- Use dust-mite proof covers for pillows, comforters, duvets, mattresses
  and box springs.
- Keep pets out of the bedroom to reduce pet dander allergen in your
  bedding.
- Wear sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to reduce pollen getting into
  your eyes.
- Keep windows closed during high pollen and mold seasons. Use the air
  conditioner in your car and home (HEPA filter).

## Skin Diseases or Conditions

### Eczema

- Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin
  condition that causes a dry, itchy rash.
    + It can occur on the face, elbows, knees, hands, and feet.
    + Eczema is not contagious.
    + It is a chronic skin condition that comes and goes, i.e., it can
      get better or worse at times.
- Numular eczema
    + a red rash and coin-shaped or oval patches on the skin.
    + Nummular eczema and ringworm can appear very similar and be
    confused with each other because both cause a circular red rash and
    itchy skin.
- The exact cause of eczema is unknown but it is believed to be a
  combination of genetic and environmental factors. Substances that
  irritate the skin can trigger eczema flares.
- Risk factors for eczema include a personal or family history of
  eczema, hay fever, or asthma.

#### Prevention

- Eczema flares can be prevented by moisturizing often, using mild
  skincare products, and having a humidifier in your room.

#### Treatments

- Treating eczema involves avoiding triggers, using mild soap, and
  keeping the skin well moisturized. Repeated scratching can lead to
  secondary skin infections, so you should avoid scratching.
- Strong Moisturizers
    + Eucerin
- Steroid cream: 1% hydrocortisone cream

### Fungal infection

- Fungal infections are skin infections caused by fungi.
- Common fungal infections include ringworm (athlete’s foot, jock itch)
  and candidiasis.
    + Ringworm, also called tinea, is a highly contagious fungal
      infection that can occur on the scalp (tinea capitis); the body
      including the upper chest, arms, and legs (tinea corporis); the
      hands and feet (tinea manus and tinea pedis); the fingernails and
      toenails (tinea unguium); and the groin (tinea cruris). It is
      called ringworm because this fungus causes a circular, red, itchy,
      scaly rash.
    + Cutaneous candidiasis is a fairly common skin infection caused by
      candida fungi. It can occur on any part of the body but is common
      in warm, moist areas with skin creases such as the groin and
      armpits. Candida yeast infections are not contagious, although
      people with weakened immune systems can sometimes catch the
      infection through skin to skin contact.
- You can prevent fungal infections by keeping your skin clean, washing
  your hands after contact with other people, not sharing towels or
  razors with others, and wearing shoes or slippers in public showers,
  locker rooms, and swimming pools.

#### Treatments

- It is possible to treat ringworm and candida with over-the-counter
  antifungal creams like terbinafine (Lamisil AT), clotrimazole
  (Lotrimin AF), miconazole (Cruex), and ketoconazole (Xolegel). You
  typically need to use these antifungal medications for 2-4 weeks. If
  the infection does not go away or gets worse, you should seek
  professional medical care from a healthcare provider who can make an
  accurate diagnosis and prescribe the right treatment, including
  stronger antifungal medications, such as griseofulvin (Grifulvin),
  itraconazole (Sporanox), and fluconazole (Diflucan), if needed.

### Scabies (benh ghe)

- Scabies is a contagious skin condition caused by a parasitic mite that
  burrows into the skin.
- No over the counter treatment
    + Meet your doctor to get prescription treatments.
        * Medicated cream (5% permethrin)
        * Lotion and pill to kill the mites and eggs

# Drugs and Medication

## Classification and Categories

- Addictive controlled substance from DEA (Drug Enforcement
  Administration)
    + Substances are classified into 5 schedules with lower numbers
      represent higher potential for abuse, dependence, and any accepted
      medical use.
    + https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling
    + Heroin and fentanyl are Schedule I
    + Cocaine and methamphetamine are in Schedule II
- Pharmaceutical drugs are classified by their chemical structure,
  mechanism of action (how they work), therapeutic use (what they
  treat), and legal/regulatory status, often using systems like the ATC
  (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical) or FDA's classifications, grouping
  drugs that are similar in chemistry or effect for easier research,
  prescription, and understanding.

## Common addictive controlled substance / drugs

Common street drugs include opioids (heroin, fentanyl), stimulants
(cocaine, methamphetamine), and hallucinogens (LSD, MDMA). Most
addictive substances disrupt the brain's reward system by flooding it
with dopamine, leading to intense cravings and compulsive use despite
negative consequences.

Common Street Drugs and Addictive Characteristics

| Drug Category                | Common Street Names                                                                         | Addictive Characteristics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stimulants                   | Cocaine (Coke, Crack, Snow), Methamphetamine (Meth, Crystal, Ice, Speed, Crank)             | Stimulants cause a rapid and significant increase in dopamine levels, producing intense feelings of energy, alertness, and euphoria. The effects of cocaine fade quickly (within 15-30 minutes), leading users to repeat doses frequently to maintain the high, which promotes a strong psychological dependence. Methamphetamine also causes strong psychological dependence and can lead to paranoia, aggression, and psychotic behavior with long-term use.
| Hallucinogens/ Dissociatives | LSD (Acid), Psilocybin (Magic Mushrooms), MDMA (Ecstasy, Molly), PCP (Angel Dust), Ketamine | Addiction to classic hallucinogens like LSD and psilocybin is less common than with other drugs, but psychological dependence can still occur. MDMA has both stimulant and mild hallucinogenic effects and can lead to a mood-altering dependence. Dissociative anesthetics like PCP and ketamine can also be addictive; PCP use is associated with aggression and violence.
| Depressants                  | Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium), GHB, Barbiturates                                          | Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are highly addictive, as the body can become dependent on them to function normally. Withdrawal from these drugs can be medically serious and life-threatening. GHB is also addictive, causing sedation and memory loss.
| Cannabis                     | Marijuana, Weed, Pot                                                                        | Cannabis can lead to a substance use disorder, but it tends to have a lower addictive potential compared to substances like heroin or cocaine. Chronic use can lead to withdrawal symptoms like irritability, anxiety, insomnia, and strong cravings.

The potential for addiction is strongly linked to how quickly a drug
increases dopamine in the brain's reward pathways and the severity of
its withdrawal symptoms. Many street drugs are often cut with other
unknown and potentially harmful substances, like caffeine or even
fentanyl, which increases their danger and risk of overdos
