## Getting Started

## Types of Running

- Open Shoulder blades
- Straight head
- Hands 90 degrees, and near to your hip
- Lands in the front of your feet (not on toes)
- Breathe in by nose and out by mouth

## Gears

- Shoes, shirts, short pants
- Water bottles, flip/spi belts, armbands
- For long run: energy gels, energy chews

# Resistance Training

## Concepts and Terminologies

- Hypertrophy (increase muscle size)
- Strength: enhance amount of force a muscle can produce
- RM: repetition maximum
    + The amount of weight that you can lift for one repetition with
      proper form.
- General Muscle Actions:
    + Flexion: Bending a joint (e.g., biceps curl).
    + Extension: Straightening a joint (e.g., triceps extension).
    + Abduction: Moving a limb away from the midline of the body (e.g., lateral raises).
    + Adduction: Moving a limb towards the midline of the body.
- Skeletal / Voluntary Muscle groups
    + chest, back, legs, shoulders, arms, hip/glutes and core (also
      known as the trunk)
- Common skeletal/voluntary muscles
    + Shoulders:
        * The deltoids, which are located on the top and sides of the shoulders.
            - It is responsible for arm abduction
    + Arms: The biceps (front of the upper arm) and triceps (back of the upper arm) are frequently targeted.
        * biceps: Front of the upper arm, responsible for forearm flexion.
        * triceps: Back of the upper arm, responsible for forearm extension.
    + Chest: The pectoralis major muscles, located in the chest area.
        * pectoralis: Located in the chest, used for arm movement.
    + Back: The latissimus dorsi, trapezius, and erector spinae muscles are key back muscles.
        * latissimus dorsi: Large back muscles, used for arm adduction and extension.
        * trapezius: Upper back and neck muscles, involved in shoulder and neck movement.
        * erector spinae: A group of muscles in the back that help with posture and spinal movement.
    + Abdominals: The rectus abdominis (six-pack muscles), transversus abdominis (deep core muscle), and obliques (side abdominal muscles).
    + Hips/Glutes: The gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus, which are the muscles of the buttocks.
    + Legs: This includes the quadriceps (front of the thigh), hamstrings (back of the thigh), and calves (lower back of the leg).

## Dietary

Build and store new proteins faster than your body breaks down old
proteins (making hormones, ...)

### Supplements

- Protein powder
    + Ascent Whey Vanilla
        * https://www.garagegymreviews.com/ascent-whey-protein-review
    + Optimum Nutrition: Vanilla or unflavor
        * https://www.garagegymreviews.com/optimum-nutrition-100-whey-gold-standard-review
- Creatine
    + Help providing more energy for muscle
    + 5g per day

### Eat meat

1 gram of protein per pound of body weight => 150 g

### Eat more (more calories)

- Formula to calculate the number of calories you need to take in daily
  to gain 1 pound a week.
    + A. Your weight in pounds. (150)
    + B. Multiply A by 12 to get your basic calories needs. (1800)
    + C. Multiply B by 1.6 to estimate your resting metabolic rate
      (calorie burn without factoring in exercise) (2880)
    + D. Strength training: multiply the number of minutes you lift
      weights per week by 5 (140 x 5 = 700)
    + E. Aerobic training: multiply the number of minutes per week that
      you run, cycle, and play sports by 8 (100 x 8 = 800)
    + F. Add D and E, and divide by 7. (1500 / 7 = 215)
    + G. Add C and F to get your daily calorie needs. (3100)
    + H. Add 500 to G. This is your estimated daily calorie needs to
      gain 1 pound a week. (3600)

### Workout/Lift your muscles every other day

Your muscles grow when you're resting, not when you're working out

### Carbohydrates after your workout

Post-workout meals with carbs increase your insulin levels, which in
turn slows the rate of protein breakdown => gain protein more than
breakdown

### Eat Every 3 Hours

Five meal a day, every 3 hours, consume around 25-30 g
