## Types of Running

- Open Shoulder blades
- Straight head

- Lands in the front of your feet (not on toes)
- Breathe in by nose and out by mouth

## Gears

- Shoes, shirts, short pants
- Water bottles, flip/spi belts, armbands
- For long run: energy gels, energy chews

# Bodybuilding

## Maximize Muscle Building

Build and store new proteins faster than your body breaks down old
proteins (making hormones, ...)

### Eat meat

1 gram of protein per pound of body weight => 150 g


### Eat more (more calories)

- Formula to calculate the number of calories you need to take in daily
  to gain 1 pound a week.
    + A. Your weight in pounds. (150)
    + B. Multiply A by 12 to get your basic calories needs. (1800)
    + C. Multiply B by 1.6 to estimate your resting metabolic rate
      (calorie burn without factoring in exercise) (2880)
    + D. Strength training: multiply the number of minutes you lift
      weights per week by 5 (140 x 5 = 700)
    + E. Aerobic training: multiply the number of minutes per week that
      you run, cycle, and play sports by 8 (100 x 8 = 800)
    + F. Add D and E, and divide by 7. (1500 / 7 = 215)
    + G. Add C and F to get your daily calorie needs. (3100)
    + H. Add 500 to G. This is your estimated daily calorie needs to
      gain 1 pound a week. (3600)

### Work your biggest muscles

- chest, back, legs
    + squats
    + dead-lifts
    + pull-ups
    + bent-over row
    + bench presses
    + push-ups
    + dips
    + military presses
    + 2-3 three sets of 8-12 repetitions, 60 seconds' rest between sets

### Have a stiff drink

Drink one protein powder 30 to 60 minutes before your workout

### Workout/Lift your muscles every other day

Your muscles grow when you're resting, not when you're working out

### Carbohydrates after your workout

Post-workout meals with carbs increase your insulin levels, which in
turn slows the rate of protein breakdown => gain protein more than
breakdown

### Eat Every 3 Hours

Five meal a day, every 3 hours, consume around 25-30 g

### One Snack Ice Cream 2 hours after workout

### Combination of carbohydrates and protein 30 minutes before bed


# Improving strength
