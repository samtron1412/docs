# Overview

- Your immune system makes antibodies that locate germs (like bacteria
  or viruses) and fight them off.
    + After the antibodies have attacked, they stay in your blood so
      they can protect you if the same germ enters again.
    + Antibodies can often stop an infection before you get symptoms
    + But these antibodies only fight off the germs they were made for.
- Vaccination, or immunization, gives you a weakened or dead form of
  certain germs.
    + The germs aren't strong enough to make you sick, but you'll still
      make antibodies to fight them.
    + The antibodies then stick around to fight off an actual infection
      if you're ever exposed to one.
- Once enough people are immunized, germs can't spread as easily
    + less and less people get sick until the germ becomes rare or even
      goes away completely => this is called *herd immunity*
    + It is important because it protects people who can't be vaccinated
      (if they're too young or have cancer, for example)

## Shingles

- Singles, or herpes zoster, is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.
  It's the same virus that causes chickenpox.
    + After chickenpox heals, the virus moves from your skin into nerves
      along your spinal cord. It can stay inactive for many years. But
      if your immune system is weakened, the virus can become active
      again and cause shingles.
    + The most common sign of shingles is a rash, or band of blisters,
      on one side of your body.
        * Before the rash appears, the virus moves along your nerves to
          your skin causing pain, numbness, itching and tingling.
        * The rash turns into painful, fluid-filled blisters a few days
          later.
