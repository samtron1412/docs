# Overview
Remote desktop software allow a personal computer's desktop environment to be run remotely on one system, while being displayed on a separate client device.

Remote desktop software captures the mouse and keyboard inputs from the local computer (client) and sends them to the remote computer (server). The remote computer in turn sends the display commands to the local computer.
