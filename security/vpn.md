# Overview
## What?
A virtual private network also known as a VPN is a private network that extends across a public network or internet. It enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.

## Why?
VPNs can provide functionality, security and/or network management benefits to the user.
- Some VPNs allow employees to securely access a corporate intranet while located outside the office.
- Some can securely connect geographically separated offices of an organization, creating one cohesive network.
- Individual Internet users can use some VPNs to secure their wireless transactions, to circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship, and/or to connect to proxy servers for the purpose of protecting personal identity and location.
