# Overview
**Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)** is *data encryption and decryption* software that provides *cryptographic privacy* and *authentication* for data communication.

PGP is often used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications.

## History
- Phil Zimmermann created the first version of PGP encryption in 1991.
- In July 1997, PGP Inc. proposed to the IETF that there be a standard called OpenPGP.
	+ The current specification is [RFC 4880][3] (November 2007)
	+ In 2012, encryption based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA, ECDH) was extended by [RFC 6637][4]
	+ Support of EdDSA will be added by [draft-koch-eddsa-for-openpgp-00][1] proposed in 2014
