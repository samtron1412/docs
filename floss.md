# Overview
`FLOSS` stand for `Free/Libre and Open Source Software`

## Why use this term?
This term are used to be neutral between free software and open source software terms.

Do not use `FOSS` term because `FOSS` stand for `Free and Open Source Software` and the `Free` word it maybe confused with `Free cost`and not emphasize for `Freedom/Libre`.

# History
## Free software movement
The free software movement is a social movement with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain freedoms for software users, namely the freedom to run the software, to study and change the software, and to redistribute copies with or without changes.

**Richard Stallman** formally founded the movement in 1983 by launching the [GNU Project](#gnu-project).

## Open source movement
From group of people in the free software movement. In February 1998, Bruce Perens(Debian project leader) and Eric Raymond founded an organization called [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/) (OSI) to spread this movement.

- **Freedom 0**: The freedom to **run** the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- **Freedom 1**: The freedom to **study** how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as your wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
- **Freedom 2**: The freedom to **redistribute** copies so you can help your neighbor.
- **Freedom 3**: The freedom to distribute your copies of your **modified** versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

## Tips and Tricks

### Helping new contributors to your open source project

#### 1. Adding a license to a repository

`LICENSE.md`

#### 2. Establishing proper contributing guidelines

- A well-written `CONTRIBUTING.md` can describe the workflow your
project's maintainers expected contributors to follow.
    + Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
    + Links to external documentation, mailing list, or a code of
    conduct.
    +
- Try to link to an appropriate tutorials for each of processes in case
the contributor isn't yet familiar with them.
- Good examples of contributing guidelines:
    + [Atom editor][atom]
    + [react][react]
    +

#### 3. Adding a clear Code of Conduct

#### 4. Documenting your project's design, architecture and directory structure

#### 5. Creating templates for pull requests and issues

#### 6. Labeling beginner issues

Try using more specific labels, such as **good first bug**, **low
hanging fruit**, **easy**, etc. to communicate that an issue is easy
enough for an initial contribution.


#### 7. Creating a FAQ on README.md

#### 8. Recognizing all contributors
