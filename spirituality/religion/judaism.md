# Overview
Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud.

Judaism encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people.
