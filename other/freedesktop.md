freedesktop.org is open source/open discussion software projects working on interoperability and shared technology for **X Window System (X11)** desktops.

freedesktop.org is building **a base platform for desktop software on Linux and UNIX**. The elements of this platform have become the backend for higher-level application-visible APIs such as Qt, GTK+, XUL, VCL, WINE, GNOME, and KDE. The base platform is both [software](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/) and [specifications](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/).

It was founded by Havoc Pennington from Red Hat in March 2000. The project is hosted by Software in the Public Interest, the non-profit organization created by the Debian Project.

freedesktop.org was formerly known as the **X Desktop Group (XDG)**, and the abbreviation "XDG" remains common in their work.
