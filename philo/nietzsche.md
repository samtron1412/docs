4 recommendations
- Own up to envy
    + Christianity (religion) condemns envy => not the right way
- Don't be a christian and don't drink alcohol
    + Both of them reassure us that things are just fine as they are,
    sapping us the will to change our lives for the better.
    + Christianity = slave morality
        * sexlessness = purity
        * weakness = goodness
        * submission to people one hates = obedience
        * not being able to take revenge = forgiveness
- God is dead
    + culture (philosophy, art, music, literature) replaces scripture
    + university does not guide students to life. Praising Greeks use
    tragic drama to teach in a practical way.
    + moral education
    + mass democracy threatens to unleash torrents of undigested envy.
    + atheism leaves humans without guidance or morality
