## "Turtle Island:" Pre-Columbian America and Native Americans

### Turtle Island Creation Story

- [another version][turtle-island-2]

### Peopling of North America

- Land bridge between Siberia and Alaska
- Oceanic crossings in makeshift boats
- Original habitation

### Native American Society

##### Diverse and distinct language groups

- They were assembled in village centers or kin and clan based
  communities.
- Not all Native Americans were grouped into tribes
- The main Native American language groups were Algonquian and
  Iroquoian, but there were hundreds and thousands of Native American
  languages.
- The Native Americans never considered themselves to be one, unified
  people. They were Native American peoples (plural) not people
  (singular).
- The Europeans played one tribe against the other and then picked them
  off.

##### Pre-literate societies

- The evidence of pre-Columbian Indian life is wholly based on
  archeology (study artifacts) because Native Americans did not live in
  literate (reading and writing) societies. They lived i pre-literate
  societies, sowe do not have written documents for pre-Columbian Native
  American societies and very few written documents for the post-
  Columbian societies.
    + It tells us what Native American wore, ate, and how they lived and
      worshiped, but we do not get people's direct thoughts, which comes
      only from written documents.

##### Gender roles
+ Indian gender roles were largely egalitarian, namely, women and men
  were valued equally in society despite performing different roles.
+ Women were the producers and distributors of food. They grew the
  "three sisters:" maize (corn), beans, and squash, so they provided the
  majority of the food and were immensely important to the survival of
  the village.
+ Women would also cure animal hides, weave baskets, make pottery, and
  build living structures.
+ Europeans saw Indian women as over-worked dredges (machine) and they
  misunderstood their cultural importance.
+ Men were responsible for clearing the land, hunting/fishing, and
  trading. They made weapons and they fought in the wars.
+ Europeans saw Indian men as lazy because they hunted all day (hunting
  was a leisurely activity in Europe) and did not farm (which was
  women's work in Indian culture, but men's work in European culture).
+ Indian women could easily divorce their husbands if the latter
  displeased them, which was a freedom European women lacked.
+ Indian women could also be sachems (chiefs) in some tribes and they
  could compel the men to start or end warfare by withholding food. Some
  Native Americans, such as the Iroquois, were matriarchal (descent/rule
  comes down through the mother's line), where European families were
  strictly patriarchal (rule by men). These gender differences between
  Europeans and Indians were commonly used as a justification by
  Europeans to conquer the land and to civilize and/or kill the Indians.

### Politics and government

+ Leadership was not inherited but rather conferred to the most able and
  wise person.
+ Sachems could NOT be arbitrary, cruel leaders because their rule was
  consensual.
+ If a sachem hoarded wealth or tried to rule against his people's
  wishes, he would be demoted and another sachem would be chosen.
+ This confused the Europeans because they are used to their own
  absolute monarchs who inherited the crown.
+ The Europeans quickly learn that they cannot use a sachem as a puppet
  ruler, who could force his people to bend to the Europeans' will.

##### Economy

- The economy rested on trade, barter, and reciprocity, so wealth and
  power was gained by giving away material goods; so the more wealth you
  give away, the more power you have as a chief or sachem.
- The Europeans were impressed by the simple lifestyles and generous
  nature of the Indians; some Europeans argued that the Indians had
  mastered pure Christian traits which the European Christians struggled
  to practice themselves.
- Indians did not have silverware, carriages, fine silks, large opulent
  (luxurious) cities, etc. and the Europeans used this as a
  justification of conquest.

##### The Indian's Worldview and religion

- Native Americans believed that they lived among or with Nature and not
  above it, as Europeans believed. Europeans believed they had a
  Biblical mandate to conquer and subdue the earth. The Indians believed
  they were part of the natural world and that they had working
  relationship with Nature, a notion which shaped their politics,
  religion, economics and family structure.
- Native Americans believed that all of the world and its objects were
  occupied by sundry spirits. This is what they call Manitou. Indians
  had a special relationship with Nature and animals; because of their
  belief in Manitou (spiritual power)
- They believed that everything had to be in balance and never wasted or
  abused or they would be punished via disease, starvation, and/or
  warfare.
- They had learned that if they over harvested animals and/or plants in
  one are, then there would be an unbalance in Nature and the village
  would starve as a result. So, Indians did NOT love Nature so much as
  they feared it.
- This is why they moved their villages according to the seasons, so
  they did not over deplete the resource in one area.
- Native Americans also would connect with the divine by dancing,
  smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, and fasting.
- Europeans labeled as demonic and hateful to God. The nature of Indian
  religion, thus, was also another handy excuse for Europeans to conquer
  the Indians.

##### Cultural Practices

- Large Native American civilizations were mostly in Mexico and South
  America (Olmec, Maya, Aztec), but they were also in North America. For
  example, Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.
- The role of the Native Americans in the Europeans colonization of the
Americas in critical. The Europeans depended on the Indians for the
survival of their colonies. They made powerful political alliances with
Indian villages and formed trading relationships which lasted for
centuries.
- The American character was formed out of the mixture between European,
African, and Indian cultures.

## "The Invasion of America:" European Exploration, Discovery, and Conquest of North America

### America: Virgin or Widow?

- Europeans did not conquer "virgin soil" but rather conquered and
  dispossessed the land's Indian inhabitants.
- The prevalent myth that we still hear today came from the Europeans
  conquerors, namely, that INdians were savages in a wild wilderness,
  and they lacked the necessary civilization to cultivate the wilds and
  carve civilization out of them. Because the Indians stubbornly refused
  civilization and they refused God, their dispossession of the land and
  the destruction of their lives were inevitable.

### Who were the Conquerors?

- Europe was emerging from centuries of being colonized and enduring
  continual conflict and conquest during this period.
- Western Europe still had a feudalistic economy - power is based on the
  control of land and strong political alliances. Peasants work the land
  of local powerful lords.
    + Society? Lots of peasants and few elites. There is very little
      social mobility, rather one's social station is
      contingent(dependent) on one's birth rank.
- Gender?
    + Men are the head of the household (little comonwealth; the
      king rules the kingdom as the husband rules the household) and
      women are submissive and inferior. Patriarchal society.
    + Women usually cared for the children, worked with textiles, and
      performed domestic chores, where men farmed and tended livestock.
    + The gender roles become more stringent the more elite one is.
- Religion and politics overlap in Europe
    + non-Christians are considered to be infidels, who Christians
      sought to Christianize.
    + Medieval theologians argued that conquest was not legitimate
      unless it was a just war. This created problems for making war
      against distant enemies, but fortunately, any war fought under the
      jurisdiction of the Holy Church was deemed(considered) just.
    + Christianity became a pretext for feudal conquest; religious
      superiority would be replaced by racial superiority out of this
      feudal society.
    + Christians vs. heathens would become whites vs. the colored.
- Western Europe possessed large domesticated(tame) draft animals, steel
  and gunpowder, daunting(powerful) weapons such as canons, armor,
  ships, water wheels, and grist mills, so they had more of a material
  culture than the Americas and Africa and therefore had an advantage.
- What were they looking for? They were looking for gold (fill the
  nation's coffers(ngan kho quoc gia)) and the fabled Nortwest Passage
  to the Pacific Ocean, so they could control both oceans.

### Christopher Columbus (1451)

- Christopher Columbus was from Genoa, Italy.
    + His father was from the low-middle class and worked as a merchant
    who did all of his business with Africa.
    + Columbus was not a legend in his own time and he never sat for a
    portrait.
    + He needed sponsorship to sail west, but Portugal and England
      turned him down because the voyage was expensive and sailing west
      seemed foolhardy(reckless).
    + In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella united their Spanish kingdoms
      through their marriages and expelled the Muslims from Spain. Flush
      with victory, they sponsored Columbus.
- Columbus ventured across the ocean not because he wanted to prove that
  the Earth war round (most Europeans already had known the Earth was
  round for centuries), but because he wanted to circumvent(avoid) the
  Middle Eastern Muslim merchants and reach the gold and spices of the
  Indies (Asia).
- China glowed in European minds as a place of many treasures from their
  understanding of Marco Polo's sojourn(stay) in China.
- The Muslim merchants served as middle men for trade between China and
  Europe, so Columbus decided that he could sail across the Atlantic
  eliminate the Muslim middle men, and trade directly with the Indies.
- In 1492, Columbus landed in the Bahamas and made the first European
  colony in Hispaniola (Haiti).
    + He made a total of four voyages and was the first governor.
    + He was eventually fired and sent back to Europe.
    + He never set foot on the North American mainland and he never
      really accepted that he was not in the Indies.
    + Columbus would bring three worlds together thus: the Americans,
      Africa, and Europe. This would prove to be one of the most pivotal
      moments in history.

## "The Columbian Exchange:" The Biological and Cultural Consequences of Columbus's Discovery for Europe, Africa, and the Americas

### African Society

- Like the Native Americans, Africans possessed diverse cultures and
  language groups
    + There were Berbers along the Mediterranean (Northern Africa), who
      were Muslims. Muslims dominated on the East Coast of Africa as
      well.
    + There were Bantu speaking peoples in the South East of Africa.
    + Upper Guinea or West Africa was Muslim, where Africans practiced
      their traditional religions in Lower Guinea.
- Like Europe, Africa was an agricultural society. Most of Africa's
  power and trade was centered on the Muslim East Coast.
- Unlike Europe, African communities were based on clan or kinship,
  where European communities were based on work and trade.
- Like Europe, Africa was a feudalistic society with powerful monarchs.
- Africa had been trading with Europe for a millennia, so it was not
  isolated like the Americas had been.
- Religion: Africans were mostly polytheistic (belief in many gods) and
  steeped in nature. They also practiced ancestor worship.
- Gender/family: African  families were larger - extended families -
  than the nuclear families in Europe. Gender roles were more
  egalitarian as men's and women's roles had equal value.

### The Atlantic

- The Atlantic became well traveled after Columbus's rediscovery of the
  New World after the Vikings.
- The Europeans expanded world trade, which leads to the beginnings of
  capitalism and the accumulated(built up) wealth strengthens the
  European states and leads to the rise of cities such as London.
- The accumulation of wealth also led to the expansion of social classes
  in Europe and enriched European intellectual life (woke up the
  universities)

### The Columbian Exchange

- The exchange of peoples, diseases, wares, flora, fauna permanently
  altered the New World.
- Three worlds collide in this global exchange: Africa, Western Europe,
  and the Americans.
- Disease brought by Africans and Europeans had a long-term affect on
  Native Americans' politics, society, religion, and family structure.
- Native Americans subsisted(survived) on mainly the "three sisters:"
  beans, squash, and maize (corn)
- Potatoes, corn, tomatoes, pumpkins, spices came from the Americans and
  are sent to Africa and Western Europe, which creates a population
  explosion in the Old World.
- The Old World sends horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, dogs, goats,
  cattle, cats, and wheat to America.
    + Horses once roamed America in the Pre-Columbian period, but they
      died out along with camels; European re-introduced them back into
      the Americas and Indians readily adopted them in the Plains.
    + The horse allowed Indians to defend themselves from Europeans and
      enemy tribes, attain more food, move camps further and more
      effectively, encouraged more bloody warfare between the tribes,
      and aided Indians in raiding European herds.
- The Indians hated pigs because the Europeans allowed them to roam the
  continent and they rooted up Indian gardens.
- The European also accidentally bring weeds, rats, and grasses to the
  New World.
- The dandelion was called the "European footprint" by Indians -
  wherever a European set his foot, these weeds would spring up.
- Where Europeans go, rats will follow. Rats quickly honeycombed the
  islands with their burrows(passages in the ground) and spread disease.
- Sugar and slaves come into the Americas from Africa.
- The Americas sent cassava, chili peppers, pumpkins, peanuts, squash,
  corn, and sweet potatoes to Africa.
- Population doubles in the Old World due to the higher yield of America
  foodstuffs. This population explosion in Africa will fuel the slave
  trade. The population explosion in Europe will fuel the Industrial
  revolution.

### Its like we were born to die...

- The Old World also introduces new diseases such as yellow fever, small
  pox, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, typhus, and malaria to
  America.
- Most of the epidemics occurred in the first 100 years of contact and
  decimated the tribe's populations from Canada to the Caribbean.
- The mass die off of Native Americans also facilitated European
  colonization.
- They lost faith in their shamans who could not save them from the
  diseases, so they were more likely to convert to Christianity when
  they saw that the Christian Europeans were not falling ill.
- Smallpox was the most virulent disease among the Indians: it enters
  the respiratory(relating to breathing) system and is highly contagious
  (passing by touching).
- Africa sends slaves to re-people the Americas and grow sugarcane and
  tobacco. Slaves usually came from the West-African coast. Merchants
  from Europe went to the African West Coast and traded European wares
  for slaves. The Europeans then took the slaves to the Americas (mostly
  the Caribbean) and dropped off the slaves and picked up sugar, which
  they then brought back to Europe: this is called the Triangle Trade.
