## "Turtle Island:" Pre-Columbian America and Native Americans

### Turtle Island Creation Story

- [another version][turtle-island-2]

### Peopling of North America

- Land bridge between Siberia and Alaska
- Oceanic crossings in makeshift boats
- Original habitation

### Native American Society

##### Diverse and distinct language groups

- They were assembled in village centers or kin and clan based
  communities.
- Not all Native Americans were grouped into tribes
- The main Native American language groups were Algonquian and
  Iroquoian, but there were hundreds and thousands of Native American
  languages.
- The Native Americans never considered themselves to be one, unified
  people. They were Native American peoples (plural) not people
  (singular).
- The Europeans played one tribe against the other and then picked them
  off.

##### Pre-literate societies

- The evidence of pre-Columbian Indian life is wholly based on
  archeology (study artifacts) because Native Americans did not live in
  literate (reading and writing) societies. They lived i pre-literate
  societies, sowe do not have written documents for pre-Columbian Native
  American societies and very few written documents for the post-
  Columbian societies.
    + It tells us what Native American wore, ate, and how they lived and
      worshiped, but we do not get people's direct thoughts, which comes
      only from written documents.

##### Gender roles
+ Indian gender roles were largely egalitarian, namely, women and men
  were valued equally in society despite performing different roles.
+ Women were the producers and distributors of food. They grew the
  "three sisters:" maize (corn), beans, and squash, so they provided the
  majority of the food and were immensely important to the survival of
  the village.
+ Women would also cure animal hides, weave baskets, make pottery, and
  build living structures.
+ Europeans saw Indian women as over-worked dredges (machine) and they
  misunderstood their cultural importance.
+ Men were responsible for clearing the land, hunting/fishing, and
  trading. They made weapons and they fought in the wars.
+ Europeans saw Indian men as lazy because they hunted all day (hunting
  was a leisurely activity in Europe) and did not farm (which was
  women's work in Indian culture, but men's work in European culture).
+ Indian women could easily divorce their husbands if the latter
  displeased them, which was a freedom European women lacked.
+ Indian women could also be sachems (chiefs) in some tribes and they
  could compel the men to start or end warfare by withholding food. Some
  Native Americans, such as the Iroquois, were matriarchal (descent/rule
  comes down through the mother's line), where European families were
  strictly patriarchal (rule by men). These gender differences between
  Europeans and Indians were commonly used as a justification by
  Europeans to conquer the land and to civilize and/or kill the Indians.

### Politics and government

+ Leadership was not inherited but rather conferred to the most able and
  wise person.
+ Sachems could NOT be arbitrary, cruel leaders because their rule was
  consensual.
+ If a sachem hoarded wealth or tried to rule against his people's
  wishes, he would be demoted and another sachem would be chosen.
+ This confused the Europeans because they are used to their own
  absolute monarchs who inherited the crown.
+ The Europeans quickly learn that they cannot use a sachem as a puppet
  ruler, who could force his people to bend to the Europeans' will.

##### Economy

- The economy rested on trade, barter, and reciprocity, so wealth and
  power was gained by giving away material goods; so the more wealth you
  give away, the more power you have as a chief or sachem.
- The Europeans were impressed by the simple lifestyles and generous
  nature of the Indians; some Europeans argued that the Indians had
  mastered pure Christian traits which the European Christians struggled
  to practice themselves.
- Indians did not have silverware, carriages, fine silks, large opulent
  (luxurious) cities, etc. and the Europeans used this as a
  justification of conquest.

##### The Indian's Worldview and religion

- Native Americans believed that they lived among or with Nature and not
  above it, as Europeans believed. Europeans believed they had a
  Biblical mandate to conquer and subdue the earth. The Indians believed
  they were part of the natural world and that they had working
  relationship with Nature, a notion which shaped their politics,
  religion, economics and family structure.
- Native Americans believed that all of the world and its objects were
  occupied by sundry spirits. This is what they call Manitou. Indians
  had a special relationship with Nature and animals; because of their
  belief in Manitou (spiritual power)
- They believed that everything had to be in balance and never wasted or
  abused or they would be punished via disease, starvation, and/or
  warfare.
- They had learned that if they over harvested animals and/or plants in
  one are, then there would be an unbalance in Nature and the village
  would starve as a result. So, Indians did NOT love Nature so much as
  they feared it.
- This is why they moved their villages according to the seasons, so
  they did not over deplete the resource in one area.
- Native Americans also would connect with the divine by dancing,
  smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, and fasting.
- Europeans labeled as demonic and hateful to God. The nature of Indian
  religion, thus, was also another handy excuse for Europeans to conquer
  the Indians.

##### Cultural Practices

- Large Native American civilizations were mostly in Mexico and South
  America (Olmec, Maya, Aztec), but they were also in North America. For
  example, Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.
- The role of the Native Americans in the Europeans colonization of the
Americas in critical. The Europeans depended on the Indians for the
survival of their colonies. They made powerful political alliances with
Indian villages and formed trading relationships which lasted for
centuries.
- The American character was formed out of the mixture between European,
African, and Indian cultures.

## "The Invasion of America:" European Exploration, Discovery, and Conquest of North America

### America: Virgin or Widow?

- Europeans did not conquer "virgin soil" but rather conquered and
  dispossessed the land's Indian inhabitants.
- The prevalent myth that we still hear today came from the Europeans
  conquerors, namely, that INdians were savages in a wild wilderness,
  and they lacked the necessary civilization to cultivate the wilds and
  carve civilization out of them. Because the Indians stubbornly refused
  civilization and they refused God, their dispossession of the land and
  the destruction of their lives were inevitable.

### Who were the Conquerors?

- Europe was emerging from centuries of being colonized and enduring
  continual conflict and conquest during this period.
- Western Europe still had a feudalistic economy - power is based on the
  control of land and strong political alliances. Peasants work the land
  of local powerful lords.
    + Society? Lots of peasants and few elites. There is very little
      social mobility, rather one's social station is
      contingent(dependent) on one's birth rank.
- Gender?
    + Men are the head of the household (little comonwealth; the
      king rules the kingdom as the husband rules the household) and
      women are submissive and inferior. Patriarchal society.
    + Women usually cared for the children, worked with textiles, and
      performed domestic chores, where men farmed and tended livestock.
    + The gender roles become more stringent the more elite one is.
- Religion and politics overlap in Europe
    + non-Christians are considered to be infidels, who Christians
      sought to Christianize.
    + Medieval theologians argued that conquest was not legitimate
      unless it was a just war. This created problems for making war
      against distant enemies, but fortunately, any war fought under the
      jurisdiction of the Holy Church was deemed(considered) just.
    + Christianity became a pretext for feudal conquest; religious
      superiority would be replaced by racial superiority out of this
      feudal society.
    + Christians vs. heathens would become whites vs. the colored.
- Western Europe possessed large domesticated(tame) draft animals, steel
  and gunpowder, daunting(powerful) weapons such as canons, armor,
  ships, water wheels, and grist mills, so they had more of a material
  culture than the Americas and Africa and therefore had an advantage.
- What were they looking for? They were looking for gold (fill the
  nation's coffers(ngan kho quoc gia)) and the fabled Nortwest Passage
  to the Pacific Ocean, so they could control both oceans.

### Christopher Columbus (1451)

- Christopher Columbus was from Genoa, Italy.
    + His father was from the low-middle class and worked as a merchant
    who did all of his business with Africa.
    + Columbus was not a legend in his own time and he never sat for a
    portrait.
    + He needed sponsorship to sail west, but Portugal and England
      turned him down because the voyage was expensive and sailing west
      seemed foolhardy(reckless).
    + In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella united their Spanish kingdoms
      through their marriages and expelled the Muslims from Spain. Flush
      with victory, they sponsored Columbus.
- Columbus ventured across the ocean not because he wanted to prove that
  the Earth war round (most Europeans already had known the Earth was
  round for centuries), but because he wanted to circumvent(avoid) the
  Middle Eastern Muslim merchants and reach the gold and spices of the
  Indies (Asia).
- China glowed in European minds as a place of many treasures from their
  understanding of Marco Polo's sojourn(stay) in China.
- The Muslim merchants served as middle men for trade between China and
  Europe, so Columbus decided that he could sail across the Atlantic
  eliminate the Muslim middle men, and trade directly with the Indies.
- In 1492, Columbus landed in the Bahamas and made the first European
  colony in Hispaniola (Haiti).
    + He made a total of four voyages and was the first governor.
    + He was eventually fired and sent back to Europe.
    + He never set foot on the North American mainland and he never
      really accepted that he was not in the Indies.
    + Columbus would bring three worlds together thus: the Americans,
      Africa, and Europe. This would prove to be one of the most pivotal
      moments in history.

## "The Columbian Exchange:" The Biological and Cultural Consequences of Columbus's Discovery for Europe, Africa, and the Americas

### African Society

- Like the Native Americans, Africans possessed diverse cultures and
  language groups
    + There were Berbers along the Mediterranean (Northern Africa), who
      were Muslims. Muslims dominated on the East Coast of Africa as
      well.
    + There were Bantu speaking peoples in the South East of Africa.
    + Upper Guinea or West Africa was Muslim, where Africans practiced
      their traditional religions in Lower Guinea.
- Like Europe, Africa was an agricultural society. Most of Africa's
  power and trade was centered on the Muslim East Coast.
- Unlike Europe, African communities were based on clan or kinship,
  where European communities were based on work and trade.
- Like Europe, Africa was a feudalistic society with powerful monarchs.
- Africa had been trading with Europe for a millennia, so it was not
  isolated like the Americas had been.
- Religion: Africans were mostly polytheistic (belief in many gods) and
  steeped in nature. They also practiced ancestor worship.
- Gender/family: African  families were larger - extended families -
  than the nuclear families in Europe. Gender roles were more
  egalitarian as men's and women's roles had equal value.

### The Atlantic

- The Atlantic became well traveled after Columbus's rediscovery of the
  New World after the Vikings.
- The Europeans expanded world trade, which leads to the beginnings of
  capitalism and the accumulated(built up) wealth strengthens the
  European states and leads to the rise of cities such as London.
- The accumulation of wealth also led to the expansion of social classes
  in Europe and enriched European intellectual life (woke up the
  universities)

### The Columbian Exchange

- The exchange of peoples, diseases, wares, flora, fauna permanently
  altered the New World.
- Three worlds collide in this global exchange: Africa, Western Europe,
  and the Americans.
- Disease brought by Africans and Europeans had a long-term affect on
  Native Americans' politics, society, religion, and family structure.
- Native Americans subsisted(survived) on mainly the "three sisters:"
  beans, squash, and maize (corn)
- Potatoes, corn, tomatoes, pumpkins, spices came from the Americans and
  are sent to Africa and Western Europe, which creates a population
  explosion in the Old World.
- The Old World sends horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, dogs, goats,
  cattle, cats, and wheat to America.
    + Horses once roamed America in the Pre-Columbian period, but they
      died out along with camels; European re-introduced them back into
      the Americas and Indians readily adopted them in the Plains.
    + The horse allowed Indians to defend themselves from Europeans and
      enemy tribes, attain more food, move camps further and more
      effectively, encouraged more bloody warfare between the tribes,
      and aided Indians in raiding European herds.
- The Indians hated pigs because the Europeans allowed them to roam the
  continent and they rooted up Indian gardens.
- The European also accidentally bring weeds, rats, and grasses to the
  New World.
- The dandelion was called the "European footprint" by Indians -
  wherever a European set his foot, these weeds would spring up.
- Where Europeans go, rats will follow. Rats quickly honeycombed the
  islands with their burrows(passages in the ground) and spread disease.
- Sugar and slaves come into the Americas from Africa.
- The Americas sent cassava, chili peppers, pumpkins, peanuts, squash,
  corn, and sweet potatoes to Africa.
- Population doubles in the Old World due to the higher yield of America
  foodstuffs. This population explosion in Africa will fuel the slave
  trade. The population explosion in Europe will fuel the Industrial
  revolution.

### Its like we were born to die...

- The Old World also introduces new diseases such as yellow fever, small
  pox, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, typhus, and malaria to
  America.
- Most of the epidemics occurred in the first 100 years of contact and
  decimated the tribe's populations from Canada to the Caribbean.
- The mass die off of Native Americans also facilitated European
  colonization.
- They lost faith in their shamans who could not save them from the
  diseases, so they were more likely to convert to Christianity when
  they saw that the Christian Europeans were not falling ill.
- Smallpox was the most virulent disease among the Indians: it enters
  the respiratory(relating to breathing) system and is highly contagious
  (passing by touching).
- Africa sends slaves to re-people the Americas and grow sugarcane and
  tobacco. Slaves usually came from the West-African coast. Merchants
  from Europe went to the African West Coast and traded European wares
  for slaves. The Europeans then took the slaves to the Americas (mostly
  the Caribbean) and dropped off the slaves and picked up sugar, which
  they then brought back to Europe: this is called the Triangle Trade.


## "To Subdue the Earth:" European Colonization in North America

### Legitimating Colonization

- How do the Europeans legitimated their colonization of the Americas.
    + In Western Europe, Christianity endorsed a policy of domination,
      where the mission of man, according to Biblical mandate, was "to
      subdue the earth" and civilize it by cultivating it (Genesis
      1:28).
    + Europeans did not believe in living in balance with Nature, but
      rather they believed that Nature was to be dominated due to their
      Christian beliefs: "have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
      over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth
      upon the earth."
    + However, the motive for European  colonization was mostly, if not
      wholly, economic rather than religious in nature, as Europeans
      lusted after natural resources and precious metals.
- The French, the Dutch, and the English quickly involved themselves in
  the fur trade, which necessitated alliances with certain Indian tribes
  such as the Huron and the Iroquois.
    + The Indians wanted iron implements (tools), weapons, alcohol, and
      cloth/fabric in exchange for furs.
- Both Europeans and Native Americans would change culturally from their
  mutual contact; both sides were also mutual dependent on the other and
  realized that they could not dominate the other at least in the
  beginning.
- The Europeans used the excuse of converting the Indians to
Christianity to legitimate their colonization of the Americas.
    + The Jesuits (French priests who the Indians called "Black Robes")
      were successful with his goal of conversion because they used
      syncretism, namely, they adapted or blended Christianity to Indian
      spiritual beliefs.
    + They did not insist that the Indians change their traditional ways
      of life and they learned Indian languages and lived among their
      potential converts.
    + Indians were also receptive to believing in multiple religions
      unlike Christians because they were polytheistic (belief in many
      gods), so it was easy for Indians to adapt Christianity and add
      one more god to the pantheon of many divinities.

### Diversity of Colonial Enterprises



## "Many Thousands Gone:" Indentured Servitude and the Emergence of Racial Slavery in Colonial English America

## "Baubles of Britain:" Mercantilism and the Consumer Revolution in the Colonies

### Britain's Economic Empire

- If one understands the economic and political aspects of the American
  Colonies, then explaining why the American Revolution took place and
  why the American colonists felt compelled to separate from Great
  Britain will be easy.
- Let us examine how England unwittingly(unknowingly) set an economic
  precedent in the American Colonies - a precedent which the American
  colonists became comfortable with and would wish to protect even if it
  meant rebellion and eventual separation.
- All of the English colonies differed in their religion; in what
  commodities they exported; in their labor systems; in their
  metropolitan status (the availability of a harbor dictated city
  structure); in their types of immigrants; in their gender ratios; and
  in their cultural developments. They connected to the Atlantic Basin's
  trade system via their connection with Great Britain.
- There was no real capitalism yet. The prevalent(common) economic
  system in the 18th century was mercantilism (an early form of
  capitalism), which entailed(required) the accumulation(build-up) of
  wealth or gold in order to strengthen the Nation-State.
    + Shipping the natural resources back to the mother country to be
    manufactured and then sold elsewhere for money.
    + The mother country must export finished goods and import raw
    materials.
    + Countries that exported more finished goods were wealthy and
    financially independent; those countries that imported more finished
    goods than they exported were finally dependent and usually in debt.

### British Economic Regions in America

Similar regions which exported similar commodities:
1. The New England region (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
Connecticut): corn, lumber, fishing, livestock, and whaling.
2. The Middle Colonies region (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware): wheat (the bread basket of the colonies)
3. The Chesapeake region (Virginia and Maryland): vast plantations with
a direct reliance on slavery. Tobacco and wheat.
4. The Lower South region (North and South Carolina and Georgia): rice,
tobacco, and indigo.

### Gaining Economic Control

- To maximize its profits, England enacted (legislated) navigation acts
to systematize trade with the American colonies and keep the colonists
from trading with other countries, as smuggling(stealing) negated the
main goal of mercantilism.
- In 1651, England enacted(pass) the fist Navigation Acts.
    + only English ships can ferry goods
    + specified commodities such as tobacco can only be sold to England
    and no where else
    + all goods sold in the colonies must go through English ports and
    duties must be paid on them
    + certain commodities such as finished woolen goods cannot be
    exported from the colonies.
- The American colonists still find ways around the strictures of the
Navigation Acts and smuggling runs rampant.
- For the most part, England is lax(careless) about smuggling and the
colonists become accustomed to this latitude(freedom) or indulgence
(privilege).

### Other Economic Acts

- In 1699, Parliament(Legislature) enacted the Woolens Act, which
mandated(commanded) that no finished woolen items were to be exported
from North America and that the colonists had to provide only natural
materials.
- In 1733, Parliament enacted the Molasses(syrup) Act, which maintained
that any molasses that was imported from Cuba or any other sugar
producing isle in the Caribbean into the colonies had a tax on it unless
it was imported from Jamaica, which was a British-owned colony.
- In 1750, Parliament enacted the Iron Act, which dictated that no
finished iron items were to be exported from North America.

### Effects of Mercantilism

- The accumulation of wealth allowed the nation-states to build massive
standing armies.
- People were thinking of themselves as a people of a nation rather than
identifying themselves under one powerful lord or ruler.
- Merchants gained a lot of wealth and power under mercantilism.
- There is no free trade because the government is intimately(closely)
involved in regulating commerce.
- The majority of labor is not waged labor but rather bonded labor.
- In capitalism, the workers are also consumers, but this is not the
case under mercantilism. Mercantilism is about suppressing the workers
and forcing them to do the job required of them.
- The most profitable commodities in the colonies: gold, silver, sugar,
tobacco, rice, indigo, timber, fur, coffee, tar/pitch, etc.
    + Property-owning Americans' lifestyles improved, for their growing
    wealth allowed them to buy amenities(luxuries) such as furniture and
    silverware.
    + The colonists' diets also improved, so they became healthier and
    lived longer.
    + Society became more diverse and stratified; there was a growing
    gap between the rich and poor.
    + The elite sought to educate their children in Europe and to
    cultivate refined manners.
    + The population in the English colonies expanded rapidly during the
    18th century (the population doubled every 25 years) due to natural
    increase, voluntary migration, and involuntary migration (slaves
    and convicts).
- The Middle Colonies (Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware)
especially experienced economic growth during the end of the 18th
century and expanded rapidly.
    + this represents what would become pluralistic America.
    + Germans, Scots, the Irish, and the Scotch-Irish, lured by the
    promise of cheap land and religious toleration, are the first to
    join the Englishmen in the diverse Middle Colonies.

### The Good and the Bad

- Positive things about being part of the British Empire economically:
    + Notable economic growth from 1607-1776
- Negative aspects:
    + Britain controlled the prices of commodities and limited the
    colonial economy.

## "Tyranny of All Kinds is to be Abhorred(hated):" The English Constitution, the Structure of Colonial Government, and Whig Politico Ideologies of Freedom

Whig politico: a member of a British political party of the 18th and
early 19th centuries which wanted to limit royal power, adn later became
the Liberal Party.

### England as the Political Precedent

- The Magna Carta or the "Great Charter" was written in 1215 and
affirmed the rule of law.
    + King John was forced by leading barons to sign the Magna Carta
    which maintained that the kind could not tax without the consent of
    those being taxed; the king had to work in accord with Parliament
    (the talking place) and recognize its right to exist; the king
    cannot confiscate property without the consent of Parliament; and a
    free person cannot be imprisoned without the judgment of his peers
    (trial by jury).
    + Basically, the Magna Carta asserted that not even monarchs were
    above the law, but were bound to uphold and obey them.
    + This made England a Constitutional Monarchy instead of an Absolute
    Monarchy.
- James I, Charles I, Charles II, and James II (1603-1688) were English
monarchs (The Stuarts: Scottish Royal Family) in the 17th century who
believed they were God's representative on earth and thus had a "divine
right" to rule.
    + Charles I ignored Parliament for eleven years and tried to rule
    without it despite the mandates of the Magna Carta.
    + As a result, England's first Civil War begins in 1642.
    + Oliver Cromwell (a Parliamentarian leader and Puritan) captures
    Charles I, has him tried for treason(disloyalty), and beheaded
    (executed) in 1649.
    + James II also tried to rule without Parliament and converted to
    Catholicism, which provoked the Anglican English ruling class to
    overthrow him in a bloodless coup called the Glorious Revolution in
    1688.
- James II's daughter and her husband William of Orange, who was a
  Protestant, take the throne and approve the English Bill of Rights in
  1689.
    + Affirmed the principle of parliamentary supremacy: free elections,
    no taxation without representation, no standing armies in peacetime,
    the right to bear arms, property rights, and trial by jury.

### John Locke's Philosophy

- The English philosopher John Locke, who wrote *Two Treaties of Civil
Government* (1691), was also influential in forming colonial political
beliefs.
    + John Locke believed that the government was an agreement between
      the ruler and those being ruled.
    + People consent(agree) to be governed and they are allowed to take
      power back if the ruler is abusing it.
    + So power is derived(obtained) from people's consent and not by
      divine right.
    + The role of government is to protect its denizens'(resident)
      natural rights of life, liberty, and property and if they fail to
      do so, the people have the right to overthrow.
- Thomas Jefferson was a fan of Locke and inscribed(imprinted) Lockean
principles in his Declaration of Independence.

### Structure of Colonial Government

- Virginia and the New England colonies were set up by joint-stock
companies.
    + The companies usually picked a governor, who the king approved.
    + The companies also allowed the colonists to elect their colonial
    legislature, so the colonists got used to governing themselves.
    + The legislatures gained autonomy(independence) and they did not
    always follow the edicts(orders) of the Crown. This was England's
    first mistake in allowing the American colonists to get so used to
    their local autonomy.
    + The first colonial elected assembly is the House of Burgesses,
    which was formed in 1619 in the Virginia colony. Requirements of
    voting: being 16 years or older and ownership of property.
- Structure of the English Government:
    + The Monarch (Executive)
    + The House of Lords
    + The House of Commons (Legislative)
    + Counties and Boroughs (Local Government)
- Structure of Colonial Government
    + The Governor (Executive)
    + The Council
    + The Assembly (Legislative)
    + Towns and Counties (Local Government)

### Realities of Colonial Government

- Royal colonies were governed under the king by a colonial governor
  appointed by the king and a self-governing colonial assembly that is
  elected by the colonists.
    + There were clear divisions or authority between the governor, who
    owes his allegiance(loyalty) to the crown, and the colonial
    legislature, which is expanding its authority in order to make it
    own decisions for local or colonial needs and issues.
    + The local assemblies were seen as protecting colonists' liberties
    and they had some clout(power) over royal appointees such as the
    governor and his council by controlling the latter's salary.
    + The English king never really had direct authority over the
    colonists unlike the Spanish government, which never allowed its
    colonies to have local legislatures.
- By the mid 17th century, the colonies were mostly stable due to their
adoption of a stable crop and type of labor force. England also becomes
a dominant force among the empirical(observational) powers.
    + The English government was more informal at first in governing the
    colonies, but as the colonies expanded and their economic value
    increased, the English colonies came into increasing contact with
    other European colonies, which forced the English government to
    become more complex.

### A Growing American Identity

- The colonists affirmed their identity as Englishmen through the
English language and through their emulation(imitation) of English
clothing and carriages.
    + Yet, the colonists were still developing their own distinct
    identity as Americans.
    + By the end of the 17th century, the colonists were mostly born in
    America, so England and the king were far away and abstract.
    + England fails to recognize that the colonies are developing a
    mature sense of their own identity and their own political
    institutions.
    + The colonists were used to having their own newspapers and
    legislative assemblies.
    + When the colonists start demanding the same rights afforded to all
    Englishmen and representation in Parliament and England denies their
    prerogative(right) due to the former's colonial status, the
    colonists can take no more and resolve(decide) to separate.
- The Crown had turned to the colonies to defray(pay) expenses for a
series of wars: King William's War, Queen Anne's War, King George's War,
and the French and Indian War.The last two wars involved the conflict
between the French and the English over the Ohio Valley, which was
critical to the control of the Mississippi River.

### Whig-Politico Ideology

- Whig ideology:
    + there was pervasive(common) corruption in government.
    + The colonists also subscribed to Enlightenment theories of natural
    rights, rational thinking, and contractual government and they
    reviled(criticized) arbitrary government.
    + Arguments of a monarch's divine right to rule no longer swayed the
    colonists.
    + The colonists also endorsed Puritan ideals of America's optimistic
    future and its role as a paragon of freedom.
    + The colonists subscribed to the power of the English Common Law
    and the Whig oppositional theory, where they learn resistance,
    rebellion, and reform models.
- A powerful government and a standing army are exceedingly dangerous to
the liberties of the people.
- The people must be every vigilant(watchful) against absolute power and
corruption in their government and protect their liberties.
