History of the United States.

# Pre-Columbian until 1876

## "Turtle Island:" Pre-Columbian America and Native Americans

### Turtle Island Creation Story

- [another version][turtle-island-2]

### Peopling of North America

- Land bridge between Siberia and Alaska
- Oceanic crossings in makeshift boats
- Original habitation

### Native American Society

##### Diverse and distinct language groups

- They were assembled in village centers or kin and clan based
  communities.
- Not all Native Americans were grouped into tribes
- The main Native American language groups were Algonquian and
  Iroquoian, but there were hundreds and thousands of Native American
  languages.
- The Native Americans never considered themselves to be one, unified
  people. They were Native American peoples (plural) not people
  (singular).
- The Europeans played one tribe against the other and then picked them
  off.

##### Pre-literate societies

- The evidence of pre-Columbian Indian life is wholly based on
  archeology (study artifacts) because Native Americans did not live in
  literate (reading and writing) societies. They lived i pre-literate
  societies, sowe do not have written documents for pre-Columbian Native
  American societies and very few written documents for the post-
  Columbian societies.
    + It tells us what Native American wore, ate, and how they lived and
      worshiped, but we do not get people's direct thoughts, which comes
      only from written documents.

##### Gender roles
+ Indian gender roles were largely egalitarian, namely, women and men
  were valued equally in society despite performing different roles.
+ Women were the producers and distributors of food. They grew the
  "three sisters:" maize (corn), beans, and squash, so they provided the
  majority of the food and were immensely important to the survival of
  the village.
+ Women would also cure animal hides, weave baskets, make pottery, and
  build living structures.
+ Europeans saw Indian women as over-worked dredges (machine) and they
  misunderstood their cultural importance.
+ Men were responsible for clearing the land, hunting/fishing, and
  trading. They made weapons and they fought in the wars.
+ Europeans saw Indian men as lazy because they hunted all day (hunting
  was a leisurely activity in Europe) and did not farm (which was
  women's work in Indian culture, but men's work in European culture).
+ Indian women could easily divorce their husbands if the latter
  displeased them, which was a freedom European women lacked.
+ Indian women could also be sachems (chiefs) in some tribes and they
  could compel the men to start or end warfare by withholding food. Some
  Native Americans, such as the Iroquois, were matriarchal (descent/rule
  comes down through the mother's line), where European families were
  strictly patriarchal (rule by men). These gender differences between
  Europeans and Indians were commonly used as a justification by
  Europeans to conquer the land and to civilize and/or kill the Indians.

### Politics and government

+ Leadership was not inherited but rather conferred to the most able and
  wise person.
+ Sachems could NOT be arbitrary, cruel leaders because their rule was
  consensual.
+ If a sachem hoarded wealth or tried to rule against his people's
  wishes, he would be demoted and another sachem would be chosen.
+ This confused the Europeans because they are used to their own
  absolute monarchs who inherited the crown.
+ The Europeans quickly learn that they cannot use a sachem as a puppet
  ruler, who could force his people to bend to the Europeans' will.

##### Economy

- The economy rested on trade, barter, and reciprocity, so wealth and
  power was gained by giving away material goods; so the more wealth you
  give away, the more power you have as a chief or sachem.
- The Europeans were impressed by the simple lifestyles and generous
  nature of the Indians; some Europeans argued that the Indians had
  mastered pure Christian traits which the European Christians struggled
  to practice themselves.
- Indians did not have silverware, carriages, fine silks, large opulent
  (luxurious) cities, etc. and the Europeans used this as a
  justification of conquest.

##### The Indian's Worldview and religion

- Native Americans believed that they lived among or with Nature and not
  above it, as Europeans believed. Europeans believed they had a
  Biblical mandate to conquer and subdue the earth. The Indians believed
  they were part of the natural world and that they had working
  relationship with Nature, a notion which shaped their politics,
  religion, economics and family structure.
- Native Americans believed that all of the world and its objects were
  occupied by sundry spirits. This is what they call Manitou. Indians
  had a special relationship with Nature and animals; because of their
  belief in Manitou (spiritual power)
- They believed that everything had to be in balance and never wasted or
  abused or they would be punished via disease, starvation, and/or
  warfare.
- They had learned that if they over harvested animals and/or plants in
  one are, then there would be an unbalance in Nature and the village
  would starve as a result. So, Indians did NOT love Nature so much as
  they feared it.
- This is why they moved their villages according to the seasons, so
  they did not over deplete the resource in one area.
- Native Americans also would connect with the divine by dancing,
  smoking tobacco, drinking alcohol, and fasting.
- Europeans labeled as demonic and hateful to God. The nature of Indian
  religion, thus, was also another handy excuse for Europeans to conquer
  the Indians.

##### Cultural Practices

- Large Native American civilizations were mostly in Mexico and South
  America (Olmec, Maya, Aztec), but they were also in North America. For
  example, Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.
- The role of the Native Americans in the Europeans colonization of the
Americas in critical. The Europeans depended on the Indians for the
survival of their colonies. They made powerful political alliances with
Indian villages and formed trading relationships which lasted for
centuries.
- The American character was formed out of the mixture between European,
African, and Indian cultures.

## "The Invasion of America:" European Exploration, Discovery, and Conquest of North America

### America: Virgin or Widow?

- Europeans did not conquer "virgin soil" but rather conquered and
  dispossessed the land's Indian inhabitants.
- The prevalent myth that we still hear today came from the Europeans
  conquerors, namely, that INdians were savages in a wild wilderness,
  and they lacked the necessary civilization to cultivate the wilds and
  carve civilization out of them. Because the Indians stubbornly refused
  civilization and they refused God, their dispossession of the land and
  the destruction of their lives were inevitable.

### Who were the Conquerors?

- Europe was emerging from centuries of being colonized and enduring
  continual conflict and conquest during this period.
- Western Europe still had a feudalistic economy - power is based on the
  control of land and strong political alliances. Peasants work the land
  of local powerful lords.
    + Society? Lots of peasants and few elites. There is very little
      social mobility, rather one's social station is
      contingent(dependent) on one's birth rank.
- Gender?
    + Men are the head of the household (little comonwealth; the
      king rules the kingdom as the husband rules the household) and
      women are submissive and inferior. Patriarchal society.
    + Women usually cared for the children, worked with textiles, and
      performed domestic chores, where men farmed and tended livestock.
    + The gender roles become more stringent the more elite one is.
- Religion and politics overlap in Europe
    + non-Christians are considered to be infidels, who Christians
      sought to Christianize.
    + Medieval theologians argued that conquest was not legitimate
      unless it was a just war. This created problems for making war
      against distant enemies, but fortunately, any war fought under the
      jurisdiction of the Holy Church was deemed(considered) just.
    + Christianity became a pretext for feudal conquest; religious
      superiority would be replaced by racial superiority out of this
      feudal society.
    + Christians vs. heathens would become whites vs. the colored.
- Western Europe possessed large domesticated(tame) draft animals, steel
  and gunpowder, daunting(powerful) weapons such as canons, armor,
  ships, water wheels, and grist mills, so they had more of a material
  culture than the Americas and Africa and therefore had an advantage.
- What were they looking for? They were looking for gold (fill the
  nation's coffers(ngan kho quoc gia)) and the fabled Nortwest Passage
  to the Pacific Ocean, so they could control both oceans.

### Christopher Columbus (1451)

- Christopher Columbus was from Genoa, Italy.
    + His father was from the low-middle class and worked as a merchant
    who did all of his business with Africa.
    + Columbus was not a legend in his own time and he never sat for a
    portrait.
    + He needed sponsorship to sail west, but Portugal and England
      turned him down because the voyage was expensive and sailing west
      seemed foolhardy(reckless).
    + In 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella united their Spanish kingdoms
      through their marriages and expelled the Muslims from Spain. Flush
      with victory, they sponsored Columbus.
- Columbus ventured across the ocean not because he wanted to prove that
  the Earth war round (most Europeans already had known the Earth was
  round for centuries), but because he wanted to circumvent(avoid) the
  Middle Eastern Muslim merchants and reach the gold and spices of the
  Indies (Asia).
- China glowed in European minds as a place of many treasures from their
  understanding of Marco Polo's sojourn(stay) in China.
- The Muslim merchants served as middle men for trade between China and
  Europe, so Columbus decided that he could sail across the Atlantic
  eliminate the Muslim middle men, and trade directly with the Indies.
- In 1492, Columbus landed in the Bahamas and made the first European
  colony in Hispaniola (Haiti).
    + He made a total of four voyages and was the first governor.
    + He was eventually fired and sent back to Europe.
    + He never set foot on the North American mainland and he never
      really accepted that he was not in the Indies.
    + Columbus would bring three worlds together thus: the Americans,
      Africa, and Europe. This would prove to be one of the most pivotal
      moments in history.

## "The Columbian Exchange:" The Biological and Cultural Consequences of Columbus's Discovery for Europe, Africa, and the Americas

### African Society

- Like the Native Americans, Africans possessed diverse cultures and
  language groups
    + There were Berbers along the Mediterranean (Northern Africa), who
      were Muslims. Muslims dominated on the East Coast of Africa as
      well.
    + There were Bantu speaking peoples in the South East of Africa.
    + Upper Guinea or West Africa was Muslim, where Africans practiced
      their traditional religions in Lower Guinea.
- Like Europe, Africa was an agricultural society. Most of Africa's
  power and trade was centered on the Muslim East Coast.
- Unlike Europe, African communities were based on clan or kinship,
  where European communities were based on work and trade.
- Like Europe, Africa was a feudalistic society with powerful monarchs.
- Africa had been trading with Europe for a millennia, so it was not
  isolated like the Americas had been.
- Religion: Africans were mostly polytheistic (belief in many gods) and
  steeped in nature. They also practiced ancestor worship.
- Gender/family: African  families were larger - extended families -
  than the nuclear families in Europe. Gender roles were more
  egalitarian as men's and women's roles had equal value.

### The Atlantic

- The Atlantic became well traveled after Columbus's rediscovery of the
  New World after the Vikings.
- The Europeans expanded world trade, which leads to the beginnings of
  capitalism and the accumulated(built up) wealth strengthens the
  European states and leads to the rise of cities such as London.
- The accumulation of wealth also led to the expansion of social classes
  in Europe and enriched European intellectual life (woke up the
  universities)

### The Columbian Exchange

- The exchange of peoples, diseases, wares, flora, fauna permanently
  altered the New World.
- Three worlds collide in this global exchange: Africa, Western Europe,
  and the Americans.
- Disease brought by Africans and Europeans had a long-term affect on
  Native Americans' politics, society, religion, and family structure.
- Native Americans subsisted(survived) on mainly the "three sisters:"
  beans, squash, and maize (corn)
- Potatoes, corn, tomatoes, pumpkins, spices came from the Americans and
  are sent to Africa and Western Europe, which creates a population
  explosion in the Old World.
- The Old World sends horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, dogs, goats,
  cattle, cats, and wheat to America.
    + Horses once roamed America in the Pre-Columbian period, but they
      died out along with camels; European re-introduced them back into
      the Americas and Indians readily adopted them in the Plains.
    + The horse allowed Indians to defend themselves from Europeans and
      enemy tribes, attain more food, move camps further and more
      effectively, encouraged more bloody warfare between the tribes,
      and aided Indians in raiding European herds.
- The Indians hated pigs because the Europeans allowed them to roam the
  continent and they rooted up Indian gardens.
- The European also accidentally bring weeds, rats, and grasses to the
  New World.
- The dandelion was called the "European footprint" by Indians -
  wherever a European set his foot, these weeds would spring up.
- Where Europeans go, rats will follow. Rats quickly honeycombed the
  islands with their burrows(passages in the ground) and spread disease.
- Sugar and slaves come into the Americas from Africa.
- The Americas sent cassava, chili peppers, pumpkins, peanuts, squash,
  corn, and sweet potatoes to Africa.
- Population doubles in the Old World due to the higher yield of America
  foodstuffs. This population explosion in Africa will fuel the slave
  trade. The population explosion in Europe will fuel the Industrial
  revolution.

### Its like we were born to die...

- The Old World also introduces new diseases such as yellow fever, small
  pox, measles, influenza, bubonic plague, typhus, and malaria to
  America.
- Most of the epidemics occurred in the first 100 years of contact and
  decimated the tribe's populations from Canada to the Caribbean.
- The mass die off of Native Americans also facilitated European
  colonization.
- They lost faith in their shamans who could not save them from the
  diseases, so they were more likely to convert to Christianity when
  they saw that the Christian Europeans were not falling ill.
- Smallpox was the most virulent disease among the Indians: it enters
  the respiratory(relating to breathing) system and is highly contagious
  (passing by touching).
- Africa sends slaves to re-people the Americas and grow sugarcane and
  tobacco. Slaves usually came from the West-African coast. Merchants
  from Europe went to the African West Coast and traded European wares
  for slaves. The Europeans then took the slaves to the Americas (mostly
  the Caribbean) and dropped off the slaves and picked up sugar, which
  they then brought back to Europe: this is called the Triangle Trade.


## "To Subdue the Earth:" European Colonization in North America

### Legitimating Colonization

- How do the Europeans legitimated their colonization of the Americas.
    + In Western Europe, Christianity endorsed a policy of domination,
      where the mission of man, according to Biblical mandate, was "to
      subdue the earth" and civilize it by cultivating it (Genesis
      1:28).
    + Europeans did not believe in living in balance with Nature, but
      rather they believed that Nature was to be dominated due to their
      Christian beliefs: "have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
      over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth
      upon the earth."
    + However, the motive for European  colonization was mostly, if not
      wholly, economic rather than religious in nature, as Europeans
      lusted after natural resources and precious metals.
- The French, the Dutch, and the English quickly involved themselves in
  the fur trade, which necessitated alliances with certain Indian tribes
  such as the Huron and the Iroquois.
    + The Indians wanted iron implements (tools), weapons, alcohol, and
      cloth/fabric in exchange for furs.
- Both Europeans and Native Americans would change culturally from their
  mutual contact; both sides were also mutual dependent on the other and
  realized that they could not dominate the other at least in the
  beginning.
- The Europeans used the excuse of converting the Indians to
Christianity to legitimate their colonization of the Americas.
    + The Jesuits (French priests who the Indians called "Black Robes")
      were successful with his goal of conversion because they used
      syncretism, namely, they adapted or blended Christianity to Indian
      spiritual beliefs.
    + They did not insist that the Indians change their traditional ways
      of life and they learned Indian languages and lived among their
      potential converts.
    + Indians were also receptive to believing in multiple religions
      unlike Christians because they were polytheistic (belief in many
      gods), so it was easy for Indians to adapt Christianity and add
      one more god to the pantheon of many divinities.

### Diversity of Colonial Enterprises



## "Many Thousands Gone:" Indentured Servitude and the Emergence of Racial Slavery in Colonial English America

## "Baubles of Britain:" Mercantilism and the Consumer Revolution in the Colonies

### Britain's Economic Empire

- If one understands the economic and political aspects of the American
  Colonies, then explaining why the American Revolution took place and
  why the American colonists felt compelled to separate from Great
  Britain will be easy.
- Let us examine how England unwittingly(unknowingly) set an economic
  precedent in the American Colonies - a precedent which the American
  colonists became comfortable with and would wish to protect even if it
  meant rebellion and eventual separation.
- All of the English colonies differed in their religion; in what
  commodities they exported; in their labor systems; in their
  metropolitan status (the availability of a harbor dictated city
  structure); in their types of immigrants; in their gender ratios; and
  in their cultural developments. They connected to the Atlantic Basin's
  trade system via their connection with Great Britain.
- There was no real capitalism yet. The prevalent(common) economic
  system in the 18th century was mercantilism (an early form of
  capitalism), which entailed(required) the accumulation(build-up) of
  wealth or gold in order to strengthen the Nation-State.
    + Shipping the natural resources back to the mother country to be
    manufactured and then sold elsewhere for money.
    + The mother country must export finished goods and import raw
    materials.
    + Countries that exported more finished goods were wealthy and
    financially independent; those countries that imported more finished
    goods than they exported were finally dependent and usually in debt.

### British Economic Regions in America

Similar regions which exported similar commodities:
1. The New England region (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire,
Connecticut): corn, lumber, fishing, livestock, and whaling.
2. The Middle Colonies region (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware): wheat (the bread basket of the colonies)
3. The Chesapeake region (Virginia and Maryland): vast plantations with
a direct reliance on slavery. Tobacco and wheat.
4. The Lower South region (North and South Carolina and Georgia): rice,
tobacco, and indigo.

### Gaining Economic Control

- To maximize its profits, England enacted (legislated) navigation acts
to systematize trade with the American colonies and keep the colonists
from trading with other countries, as smuggling(stealing) negated the
main goal of mercantilism.
- In 1651, England enacted(pass) the fist Navigation Acts.
    + only English ships can ferry goods
    + specified commodities such as tobacco can only be sold to England
    and no where else
    + all goods sold in the colonies must go through English ports and
    duties must be paid on them
    + certain commodities such as finished woolen goods cannot be
    exported from the colonies.
- The American colonists still find ways around the strictures of the
Navigation Acts and smuggling runs rampant.
- For the most part, England is lax(careless) about smuggling and the
colonists become accustomed to this latitude(freedom) or indulgence
(privilege).

### Other Economic Acts

- In 1699, Parliament(Legislature) enacted the Woolens Act, which
mandated(commanded) that no finished woolen items were to be exported
from North America and that the colonists had to provide only natural
materials.
- In 1733, Parliament enacted the Molasses(syrup) Act, which maintained
that any molasses that was imported from Cuba or any other sugar
producing isle in the Caribbean into the colonies had a tax on it unless
it was imported from Jamaica, which was a British-owned colony.
- In 1750, Parliament enacted the Iron Act, which dictated that no
finished iron items were to be exported from North America.

### Effects of Mercantilism

- The accumulation of wealth allowed the nation-states to build massive
standing armies.
- People were thinking of themselves as a people of a nation rather than
identifying themselves under one powerful lord or ruler.
- Merchants gained a lot of wealth and power under mercantilism.
- There is no free trade because the government is intimately(closely)
involved in regulating commerce.
- The majority of labor is not waged labor but rather bonded labor.
- In capitalism, the workers are also consumers, but this is not the
case under mercantilism. Mercantilism is about suppressing the workers
and forcing them to do the job required of them.
- The most profitable commodities in the colonies: gold, silver, sugar,
tobacco, rice, indigo, timber, fur, coffee, tar/pitch, etc.
    + Property-owning Americans' lifestyles improved, for their growing
    wealth allowed them to buy amenities(luxuries) such as furniture and
    silverware.
    + The colonists' diets also improved, so they became healthier and
    lived longer.
    + Society became more diverse and stratified; there was a growing
    gap between the rich and poor.
    + The elite sought to educate their children in Europe and to
    cultivate refined manners.
    + The population in the English colonies expanded rapidly during the
    18th century (the population doubled every 25 years) due to natural
    increase, voluntary migration, and involuntary migration (slaves
    and convicts).
- The Middle Colonies (Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware)
especially experienced economic growth during the end of the 18th
century and expanded rapidly.
    + this represents what would become pluralistic America.
    + Germans, Scots, the Irish, and the Scotch-Irish, lured by the
    promise of cheap land and religious toleration, are the first to
    join the Englishmen in the diverse Middle Colonies.

### The Good and the Bad

- Positive things about being part of the British Empire economically:
    + Notable economic growth from 1607-1776
- Negative aspects:
    + Britain controlled the prices of commodities and limited the
    colonial economy.

## "Tyranny of All Kinds is to be Abhorred(hated):" The English Constitution, the Structure of Colonial Government, and Whig Politico Ideologies of Freedom

Whig politico: a member of a British political party of the 18th and
early 19th centuries which wanted to limit royal power, adn later became
the Liberal Party.

### England as the Political Precedent

- The Magna Carta or the "Great Charter" was written in 1215 and
affirmed the rule of law.
    + King John was forced by leading barons to sign the Magna Carta
    which maintained that the kind could not tax without the consent of
    those being taxed; the king had to work in accord with Parliament
    (the talking place) and recognize its right to exist; the king
    cannot confiscate property without the consent of Parliament; and a
    free person cannot be imprisoned without the judgment of his peers
    (trial by jury).
    + Basically, the Magna Carta asserted that not even monarchs were
    above the law, but were bound to uphold and obey them.
    + This made England a Constitutional Monarchy instead of an Absolute
    Monarchy.
- James I, Charles I, Charles II, and James II (1603-1688) were English
monarchs (The Stuarts: Scottish Royal Family) in the 17th century who
believed they were God's representative on earth and thus had a "divine
right" to rule.
    + Charles I ignored Parliament for eleven years and tried to rule
    without it despite the mandates of the Magna Carta.
    + As a result, England's first Civil War begins in 1642.
    + Oliver Cromwell (a Parliamentarian leader and Puritan) captures
    Charles I, has him tried for treason(disloyalty), and beheaded
    (executed) in 1649.
    + James II also tried to rule without Parliament and converted to
    Catholicism, which provoked the Anglican English ruling class to
    overthrow him in a bloodless coup called the Glorious Revolution in
    1688.
- James II's daughter and her husband William of Orange, who was a
  Protestant, take the throne and approve the English Bill of Rights in
  1689.
    + Affirmed the principle of parliamentary supremacy: free elections,
    no taxation without representation, no standing armies in peacetime,
    the right to bear arms, property rights, and trial by jury.

### John Locke's Philosophy

- The English philosopher John Locke, who wrote *Two Treaties of Civil
Government* (1691), was also influential in forming colonial political
beliefs.
    + John Locke believed that the government was an agreement between
      the ruler and those being ruled.
    + People consent(agree) to be governed and they are allowed to take
      power back if the ruler is abusing it.
    + So power is derived(obtained) from people's consent and not by
      divine right.
    + The role of government is to protect its denizens'(resident)
      natural rights of life, liberty, and property and if they fail to
      do so, the people have the right to overthrow.
- Thomas Jefferson was a fan of Locke and inscribed(imprinted) Lockean
principles in his Declaration of Independence.

### Structure of Colonial Government

- Virginia and the New England colonies were set up by joint-stock
companies.
    + The companies usually picked a governor, who the king approved.
    + The companies also allowed the colonists to elect their colonial
    legislature, so the colonists got used to governing themselves.
    + The legislatures gained autonomy(independence) and they did not
    always follow the edicts(orders) of the Crown. This was England's
    first mistake in allowing the American colonists to get so used to
    their local autonomy.
    + The first colonial elected assembly is the House of Burgesses,
    which was formed in 1619 in the Virginia colony. Requirements of
    voting: being 16 years or older and ownership of property.
- Structure of the English Government:
    + The Monarch (Executive)
    + The House of Lords
    + The House of Commons (Legislative)
    + Counties and Boroughs (Local Government)
- Structure of Colonial Government
    + The Governor (Executive)
    + The Council
    + The Assembly (Legislative)
    + Towns and Counties (Local Government)

### Realities of Colonial Government

- Royal colonies were governed under the king by a colonial governor
  appointed by the king and a self-governing colonial assembly that is
  elected by the colonists.
    + There were clear divisions or authority between the governor, who
    owes his allegiance(loyalty) to the crown, and the colonial
    legislature, which is expanding its authority in order to make it
    own decisions for local or colonial needs and issues.
    + The local assemblies were seen as protecting colonists' liberties
    and they had some clout(power) over royal appointees such as the
    governor and his council by controlling the latter's salary.
    + The English king never really had direct authority over the
    colonists unlike the Spanish government, which never allowed its
    colonies to have local legislatures.
- By the mid 17th century, the colonies were mostly stable due to their
adoption of a stable crop and type of labor force. England also becomes
a dominant force among the empirical(observational) powers.
    + The English government was more informal at first in governing the
    colonies, but as the colonies expanded and their economic value
    increased, the English colonies came into increasing contact with
    other European colonies, which forced the English government to
    become more complex.

### A Growing American Identity

- The colonists affirmed their identity as Englishmen through the
English language and through their emulation(imitation) of English
clothing and carriages.
    + Yet, the colonists were still developing their own distinct
    identity as Americans.
    + By the end of the 17th century, the colonists were mostly born in
    America, so England and the king were far away and abstract.
    + England fails to recognize that the colonies are developing a
    mature sense of their own identity and their own political
    institutions.
    + The colonists were used to having their own newspapers and
    legislative assemblies.
    + When the colonists start demanding the same rights afforded to all
    Englishmen and representation in Parliament and England denies their
    prerogative(right) due to the former's colonial status, the
    colonists can take no more and resolve(decide) to separate.
- The Crown had turned to the colonies to defray(pay) expenses for a
series of wars: King William's War, Queen Anne's War, King George's War,
and the French and Indian War.The last two wars involved the conflict
between the French and the English over the Ohio Valley, which was
critical to the control of the Mississippi River.

### Whig-Politico Ideology

- Whig ideology:
    + there was pervasive(common) corruption in government.
    + The colonists also subscribed to Enlightenment theories of natural
    rights, rational thinking, and contractual government and they
    reviled(criticized) arbitrary government.
    + Arguments of a monarch's divine right to rule no longer swayed the
    colonists.
    + The colonists also endorsed Puritan ideals of America's optimistic
    future and its role as a paragon of freedom.
    + The colonists subscribed to the power of the English Common Law
    and the Whig oppositional theory, where they learn resistance,
    rebellion, and reform models.
- A powerful government and a standing army are exceedingly dangerous to
the liberties of the people.
- The people must be every vigilant(watchful) against absolute power and
corruption in their government and protect their liberties.

## "They have Betrayed the Liberties of the People:" the March Toward Revolution

### Question of Deference(Obedience)

- After we have discussed the social, economic, and political aspects of
the American Colonies, we are now ready to examine the march of events
culminating(reach a climax) in the American Revolution.
    + Great Awakening, a religious movement in the 18th century, was a
    precursor to the Revolution because it contained the seeds of
    rebellion against elitism and authority.
- We must still ask what point did the American colonists decide that
they no longer wanted to be subjects of Great Britain and that they
wished to only show deference (submission) to the individuals who they
elected (a republic) rather than someone who they were forced to defer
to like the king (a monarchy)?
- The king was more of an abstract figurehead.
- When the Crown struck the wrong nerves and clamped down on the liberal
freedoms enjoyed in the colonies, the result would be a turn to
republicanism in America.

### Terminology of the Revolution

- What is a revolution? One definition is a violent overthrow of one
  government in favor of another.
- What is a republic? A republic is a form of government where
politicians are elected to govern for the people and people are expected
to sacrifice their own interests for the common good.
- What is liberalism? Liberalism is the notion that a person is free to
pursue his or her own needs, such as to make money.
- What is a democracy? A democracy is a form of government where you
have rule by the people.
- Modern America combines or reconciles(adjusts) the ideologies of
Machiavelli and Locke: rule by power and self interest, but also rule
for the public good.
    + There is a conflict between the freedom of the individual inherent
    to liberalism and self-sacrifice for the good of all inherent in
    republicanism.

### Grievances (Injustice) Leading to Revolution

- The events lead to the American Revolution: chronologically from 1700
to 1750.
    + At the same time that the colonial legislatures were gaining more
    independence from the Crown and more authority from the local
    governor, Parliament was becoming more powerful after the Glorious
    Revolution (1688).
    + The king's authority, however, was diminishing as Parliament
    became more powerful.
    + The colonists accustomed to a great deal of economic autonomy.
    + Politically, the colonists were not represented in Parliament;
    they could only send colonial agents to plead colonial needs and
    issues before Parliament, which could either act on the colonials'
    request or simply ignore them.
- What then was the first main grievance?
    + The French and Indian War (1754-1763) altered relationships
    between the mother country and her colonies. This war can also be
    considered as the first world war because it was fought in both
    hemispheres by multiple players: it was fought at sea and on
    battlegrounds in North America, the Caribbean, Europe, Asia, Africa,
    and India.
    + How then did it start? The French attempted to assert their
    dominion over the highly desired Ohio Valley by building multiple
    forts, which effectively blocked the British colonists' movement
    west and locked in the British Empire in North America to the east.
    A young Virginian lieutenant colonel was sent by the Virginian
    governor to scout what the French were up to in the Ohio Valley in
    1754. This lieutenant colonel happened upon a camp of Frenchmen and
    failed to stop his Indian allies from killing and scalping the whole
    group, including a French emissary. The lieutenant colonel, who
    could not speak French, then unwittingly signed a document admitting
    to murdering the French emissary and subsequently started the war
    between England and her political allies vs. France and her
    political allies. This young lieutenant colonel is better known as
    **George Washington**.
    + The British fought poorly in the war initially because the French
    and their Indian allies resorted to guerilla warfare.
    + The British effectively won the war when General Wolf captured the
    city of Quebec, which was the capital of New France.
    + In the Treaty of Paris (1763), the French forfeited(surrendered)
    all their land in North America to the British-aside from Louisiana,
    which went to Spain.
    + To save themselves from the expense of putting down another Indian
    rebellion, the British resolved to enact the Proclamation of 1763,
    which relegated(transferred) colonial land speculators and colonial
    settlers to the east of the Appalachians.
    + This appeased (satisfied) the Indians but enraged (upset) the
    colonial land speculators.
    + One cannot be free and independent if he does not have land in
    America and is saddled with debt.
- Another grievance which came out of the French and Indian War is that
the British left the standing army, which had been sent to America to
fight the French, detained in the colonies.
    + This frightened and angered the colonists who were well-versed in
    Real Whig ideology and saw standing armies as the tools of tyranny.
- The last grievance came out of the French and Indian War was that the
expense of the war had drained the British government's coffers. Thus,
the British Parliament resolved that since it had sent British soldiers
to protect the colonists from the French and Indian threat, the
colonists should pay their fair share of defraying or paying back the
costs via taxes.

### A Question of Identity

- At first the colonists did not revile (criticize) the king, but rather
they denigrated (criticize unfairly) his ministers Grenville and Bute,
who were passing edicts(order) against the colonies such as the stamp
act. The colonists believed that the king was being manipulated by
corrupt ministers.
    + The colonists also saw this influence over the king by venal
      (corrupt) ministers as a corruption of the English Constitution
      because the executive (monarch) and the legislative (Parliament)
      were supposed to be separate branches.
- The colonists had been ignoring the Navigation Acts and smuggling
goods to and from other countries, which undercut the whole goal of
mercantilism.
    + Revenue from the colonies was supposed to go through the mother
    country, so it could fill up its coffers and the mother country
    could grow richer than the neighboring countries.
- More regulation and control from England, the colonists started to
define their identity as separate from Englishmen.
    + Both England and the American colonists wanted to expand across
    the continent and reach the Pacific, so they could control land and
    lucrative (fruitful) trade with Asia. The question was: who will
    control the desired West? The American colonists? Or the British?

## "It is Their Right, it is Their Duty, to Throw off such Government:" Imperial Reform and Colonial Resistance

### The First Imposition (restraint)

- England imposed (dictate) direct taxation on the colonists, who will
see this imposition as threatening, unconstitutional, and worthy of
separation.
- The Sugar Act and Currency Acts (1764) were the first duties imposed
on the colonies.
    + The Sugar Act regulate trade.
    + The Currency Act prohibited the printing of paper money in the
    colonies.

### That Heinous (horrifying) Tax

- The Stamp Act (1765) was one of the most reviled (criticized) taxes
the British imposed on the colonies, as it was the first attempt to tax
the colonies directly.
    + It levied a "sales tax" on legal documents such as wills, deeds,
    gambling cards, and newspapers.
    + The colonists congregated (came together) in the Stamp Act
      Congress in October 1765 and wrote an edict (public order) against
      the Stamp Act.
        * In this edict to Parliament, the colonists affirm their
          loyalty as subjects of the English Crown, but they also remind
          Parliament that it is unconstitutional to tax a people who are
          not represented in Parliament.
        * They also assert to Parliament that only their local
          assemblies can domestically tax the colonists because they had
          elected the representatives and, therefore, had a say in their
          own taxation.
        * Lastly, they argued that whatever commodities are sent to
          Britain are gifts - not an obligation (debt, responsibility).
          This is an immensely important statement because it shows that
          the colonists are effectively denying their colonial
          obligations and, therefore, are negating the purpose of
          colonies under mercantilism. It also shows that the colonists
          are forming their own distinct identity and they are stepping
          away from colonialism and toward nationhood.
- The Stamp Act Congress calls on the colonists to boycott (refrain
from using, avoid, refuse) British imports, which eventually forces a
repeal of the Stamp Act in Parliament in 1766.

### Rebellious Children

- The colonists disagreed with the English government's analogy of the
colonists as rebellious children. The colonists did not feel obligated
(constrained) to Britain because they and their ancestors had fled
(past tense of flee) from poverty and intolerance; they had braved the
wilderness of the New World; and they had civilized and cultivated the
land, built homes, amassed (gathered) their own wealth, and fought in
the colonial wars.
- Both the British and the colonists have legitimate points in the
disagreements leading up to the American Revolution.
    + The British are simply asking the colonists to pay their fair
    share of taxes in the British Empire and they expect the colonists
    to uphold their obligations as colonies in the system of
    mercantilism.
    + The colonists, however, do not like that the British have changed
    the procedure from an indirect influence to a direct authority. It's
    not that the colonists mind being taxed by England, as they have
    been paying externally taxes to England for over a century. What
    they do mind, however, is being taxed internally by Parliament,
    where they have no representation. If Parliament wants to tax the
    colonies internally or domestically, then they have to let the
    colonists send representatives to Parliament. Because Parliament
    refuses to permit the colonists to have their own representatives in
    Parliament, then the only people who can constitutionally tax the
    colonies internally are the colonial representatives in the local
    assemblies. The colonists only wish to be recognized as Englishmen
    with equal rights under the English Constitution.

### The Rule of the Mob (large group of people)

- Mobs flare (erupt, spread) up in Boston, Massachusetts due to the
Stamp Act and the mobs destroy the homes of elite colonists enforcing
the Stamp Act such as Andrew Oliver and Governor Thomas Hutchinson.
- Massachusetts was the most rebellious colony despite its Puritan
history, and it had the most social strife (conflict) because it had
more poor people than any other colony.
- We can see that there are social revolutions within the political
revolution.
- The Revolution does not simply involve the British vs. the Americans,
but rather Americans vs. Americans as well.

### Lessons Learned

- Once the Stamp Act was repealed due to colonial opposition, the
colonists learned that they could protest future impositions and be
successful.
- Parliament was asserting its full authority over the colonies and
affirming that it would take any measures necessary to subdue (keep
under control) the rebellious colonists by. (the Declaratory Act)

### Questions of Authority

- The American Revolution is a period of shifting loyalties and
authority: who will have authority? The colonial legislatures or the
British Parliament? The colonial elite or the common people? Regional
differences are highlighted in the colonies as well.
- The Stamp Act is significant:
    + It set up the colonies for additional resistance
    + It helped in the formation of a distinct American identity;
    +  It created shifting identities of social order;
    + It prepared the colonists for a growing cohesion between the
    thirteen colonies.

### Another Affront (abuse)

- Parliament enacted the Townshend Duties in 1767, which imposes tariffs
  (tax or fee) on British imports such as glass, paint leads, paper, and
  tea.
- The Townshend Duties angered the colonists because the revenue raised
  from the duties would be used to defray or pay royal appointees'
  salaries in the colonies, which circumvented the colonial assemblies'
  ability to withhold salaries in order to force concessions
  (compromise).
- This sparked a non-importation movement across the colonies.
- It shows us that the thirteen colonies are working together as a unit.
- Britain responded to the non-importation movement by repealing the
Townhend Duties in 1770 except for the duty on tea, which would cause
additional problems.


## "These are the Times that Try Men's Souls:" War and the Secession(separation) from the British Empire

### The Heart of the Revolution

- In 1768, British troops were stationed in Boston in order to quell
  (suppress) the unremitting (continual) resistance and revolts
  (rebellions) in the fractious city.
    + British knew that Boston was the heart of colonial resistance and
    the wellspring, or origin, of the American Revolution.
    + The Sons of Liberty, a colonial-wide resistance association, was
      behind the protests in Boston, and Samuel Adams, the infamous
      rablle-rouser (who excites others to violence) and cousin of John
      Adams, was one of the association's leaders.
    + Aside from the resistance against British taxation, there was
    already a lot of tension in Boston due to economic stress and
    privation (poverty); in fact, Boston hosted more poor individuals
    than any other colonial city.
    + British aggravated (complicated) the situation in Boston when they
    quartered (board) their troops amid the populace and when the
    soldiers to compete with the colonists for job. The British soldiers
    also made lewd (naughty) advances on colonial women, leaving parents
    to fear for their daughters' safety and virtue.
    + This resulted in squabbles (argument) and fisticuffs (hit) between
    the colonists and the soldiers in the streets, leading to the Boston
    Massacre in 1770.
- Boston Massacre in 1770:
    + On March 5th, a young British sentry (guard) was guarding the
    Custom House throughout the night. Some colonial boys began to taunt
    and harass the sentry, attracting a large mob of irate (angry)
    colonists.
    + Captain Thomas Preston marched eight soldiers to the Custom House
    in order to aid the sentry. By the time they reached him, the
    colonial mob had grown very aggressive and began to throw hard
    packed snowballs with bricks and stones imbedded in them and other
    objects at the British soldiers. The colonists also taunted the
    soldiers, "Fire! Fire! Why don't you fire?! Shoot me if you dare!"
    + Meanwhile, Captain Preston situated himself in front of his men
    and ordered his men to hold their fire. Yet, one soldier was struck
    in the head by a club (stick), lost his footing, and discharged his
    musket. All British soldiers undergo extensive training and if a
    shot rings out, they are trained to fire their weapons.
    + Captain Preston ordered his men to cease firing, using his sword
    to knock their muskets up and out of range of the colonists.
    However, numerous colonists were injured and five Americans died of
    wounds sustained in the shooting.
    + These luckless five were instantly lauded as martyrs (sacrificing
      person) of the American resistance against British tyranny. The
      Patriot version of what happened differed greatly. Patriot and
      silversmith Paul Revere created an engraving (carving of letters
      or design into something) of the Boston Massacre as a propaganda
      tool to incite anger against the British.
    + In the engraving, Revere pictures the Americans not as a mob, but
    rather as a defenseless and non-violent gathering of citizens.
    Instead of standing in front of his men in order to halt the
    onslaught, CAptain Preston is depicted as standing in back of his
    men, ordering them to fire on the hapless Americans.
    + Even though Captain Preston and his men were defended by future
    patriot John Adams and acquitted (discharge), the Boston Massacre
    and Revere's engraving succeeded in horrifying the other American
    colonies and galvanizing (inspiring) them to further resist the
    British threat.

### Boston Harbor, A Teapot Tonight

- Parliament revoked the Townshend Duties due to colonial protests, but
it did not eliminate the tax on tea.  This effectively made tea cheaper
to buy of the colonists, so why were American Patriots angry about the
Tea Act?
    + One reason is because the Americans still resisted internal
    taxation of any form on principle.
    + Another reason is because the East India Company's monopoly
    undercut colonial smuggling and frustrated the business of notorious
    smugglers such as John Hancock.
- When three ships entered Boston harbor with the intent of dropping off
  East India Company tea, American Patriots refused to permit the ships
  to unload their cargo and Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to
  permit the ships to leave the harbor until they dropped off their
  cargo. Stuck between the two contending forces, the ships were left
  stationary in the harbor, unable to drop off their cargo and unable to
  leave.
    + The Patriots pleaded with Hutchinson to relent, but he stubbornly
    refused to bend to the rebels.
- On December 16th, American Patriots met at the Green Dragon Tavern,
where they listened to Samuel Adams speak, "I can think of nothing
further to be done as we have done all we could for the salvation
(saving) of our country." From the back of the group, there was a cry,
"Boston Harbor, a Tea Pot tonight!"
    + Colonials disguised as Mohawk INdians quietly slipped out of the
    tavern (pub, bar), boarded the ships, hatched the tea chests open,
    and dumped their contents into the harbor.
    + They were very careful to destroy no more British property except
    for the tea, and they silently melted away into the night.
    + England was outraged by this blatant (intentional) act of
    intransigence (stubbornness).
- In 1774, Parliament punished the Bostonians by enacting the Coercive
  (forced) Acts (the colonists called them the Intolerable Acts), which
  closed Boston Harbor and dissolved (discontinue) its colonial assembly
  and its town meetings.

### More Grievances (injustice)

- In 1774, Parliament passed the Quebec Act, which also angered the
American colonists because it annexed (joined) the Ohio VAlley region
(which the colonists hoped to move into after fighting for it in the
French and Indian War) to the province of Quebec and, thereby (by that),
cut off western settlement for Anglo-Americans.
    + This gave Indians protection from the encroachment (invasion) of
      land hungry colonists and alleviated (relieved) costly frontier
      squabbles (disagreement, argument) between settlers and Indians,
      but the colonists saw it as an appeasement (satisfaction) of the
      Indians.
    + The Quebec Act also mandated that Quebec would not have an elected
    assembly consisting of local colonists, but rather would receive an
    appointed council by the Crown, which really persuaded the colonists
    that the British had designs on eliminating their own local
    assemblies in the 13 Colonies and stripping them of their rights
    under the British Constitution. Hence, the British conspiracy
    becomes a reality for the American colonists.

### Question of Independence

- The American colonists still considered themselves to be Britons at
  this point and still appealed (attracted) to their rights under the
  British Constitution.
    + Most colonists wished to resolve the conflict with Britain and
    return to the limited authority over the colonies that they had
    enjoyed pre-1760s. No one was calling for independence just yet.
- However, some were starting to recognize that there was a cultural and
social difference between them and the British, namely, they started to
see themselves as uniquely American in identity and character.
- The American identity was congealing (thickening) due to hundreds of
years of interaction between different cultures: European, African, and
Native American.
- Not all of the American colonists were Patriots and favored
independence from the British during the American Revolution: 2/5 of the
population were Patriots and supported independence; 1/5 were Loyalists
and supported reconciliation (compromise) with Britain; and 2/5 were
Neutrals who cared little who was governing them so long as they were
left largely alone.

### March Toward War

- The American colonists began to prepare themselves for the possibility
of war.
    + They started to stockpile (build up) weapons and gunpowder in
    order to defend themselves from British hostilities.
    + In the fall of 1774, British General Thomas Gage learned from his
    spies that the Americans were hiding weapons in the countryside. He
    believed that if the resistance in Boston could be strangled
    (killed), then the colonial revolts (rebellions) in the other
    American colonies would cease all together.
    + In the "Powder Alarm," Gage sent out his soldiers to seize (take
      by force) the hidden gunpowder and weapons, which incited the New
      England troops to march on Boston. Although these troops were
      disbanded, General Gage was shocked because he had underestimated
      the speed and organization of the American military.
    + The colonists also learned form the "Powder Alarm" that they would
      have to set up a better spy network and disperse (scatter) their
      stockpiles of weapons and gunpowder, so they could not all be
      seized at once.
- At the same time, in late September 1774, the First Continental
Congress, which was made up of representatives of each American colony
met in order to discuss the impending (forthcoming, approaching) war.
    + They decided to organize the colonial military and they formulated
    the Committee of Safety.
    + They also approved the non-importation and non-exportation
    movements against England.
    + The Americans, felt prepared should war break out and were ready
    to defend themselves.

### The Shot Heard Round the World

- All that was needed now was a spark to start a war.
- In April 1775, General Thomas Gage sent British troops to march on
Concord, Massachusetts in order to seize the ammunition hidden there. He
also ordered the troops to apprehend (arrest) the political traitors
Samuel Adams and John Hancock.
- The New Englanders, however, were warned by William Dawes, Samuel
Prescott, and Paul Revere of the approaching British soldiers.
- Captain John Parker, a veteran of the French and Indian War, and his
minutemen met the British troops on the Lexington Green. The British
commander Major Pitcairn rode up to the Americans on the Green,
shouting, "Disperse ye rebels! Lay down your arms!" Captain Parker
ordered his men to slowly disperse from the Green. But, suddenly, a shot
rang out on one of the sides and everyone froze before the British
opened up with a volley (gunfire) at the Lexington colonists. This
single shot heralded (brought messages) the start of the American
Revolution.
- Leaving four Americans dead and numerous wounded on the Green, the
British troops resumed their march to Concord, where they seized the
left over ammunition which the Americans did not have the time to carry
away and they burned the town.
- They also skirmished (fought) with the Patriots on the Old NOrth
Bridge, where the first British blood of the war was spilled.
- When the British finished their work and marched back to Boston,
30,000 New Englanders came swarming from all over the country to chase
and snipe (taunt, criticize) at the British troops on their long
agonizing slog back to Boston. Hundreds of British soldiers were killed
as New Englanders fired at them from behind trees and boulders. Once the
British caught sight of Boston, they broke rank and ran in disorder into
the safety of the city. While the British hunkered down in the city, the
New Englanders prowled on the outskirts of the city, daring the British
to stick their noses out. These angry colonists would keep the British
detained in the city until their commander came North to organize them
into a continental army. Their commander was also a veteran of the
French and Indian War and a notable gentleman, also known as George
Washington of virginia.
- There were three British commanders in chief in America for the first
part of the war: Clinton, Howe, and Burgoyne. The continental army only
had one commander in chief in the form of George Washington.
    + Washington was not a brilliant tactical commander; nor, was he a
    skilled strategic commander. In fact, Washington lost more battles
    than he won in the American Revolution.
    + What made Washington a military genius was that he was a
    remarkable quartermaster with highly developed logistical
    (resourceful effectively) skills. He cared deeply about the welfare
    of his men and he was well aware of the odds against his army.
    + Washington was notable because he knew how to work with what he
      had and he was exceedingly resourceful. Washington was adept at
      playing cat and mouse. Well acquainted with Indian guerrilla
      (bushfighter) tactics, Washington employed the same game of
      harassment and retreat against the British, who became weary of
      chasing him and his army across the country. In the end, the
      contest would become too expensive and the British would be forced
      to throw in the towel.

### A Ragtag (no ordered) Army

- The first continental army raised by the Continental Congress was
basically a New England army because it was composed of the New
Englanders stalking (ambush) outside the outskirts of Boston.
    + They had a lot of experience because they had been meeting since
    1685.
    + Most militiamen were young men, who armed and equipped themselves.
    + They were usually farmers and craftsmen.
    + Militias (citizen soldiers) were organized in communal units,
      where they elected their leaders and near egalitarianism
      (equality) prevailed.
    + The militia would train four times out of the year even during
    peacetime.
    + The minutemen were a reserve force, which had to be able to report
    to service in a matter of minutes.
- So, we can see that the colonists already had a trained militant
  (combative) force in place to fight the British.

### So Now This Is War

- On June 17, 1775, the Second Continental Congress created the
Continental Army and enlisted General Washington as the commander in
chief.
    + John Adams suggested George Washington as commander because the
      Revolution had primarily been a New England development so far, so
      the fact that Washington was a Southerner united the Northern and
      the Southern colonies in the fight against Britain.
    + Washington set up his army in New England.
- In July 1775, the Congress tried one last time to reconcile with
  England by sending an Olive Branch Petition, but King George scorned
  (look down on) it and declared the colonies to be in rebellion,
  effectively declaring war on the colonies in the same year.
    + England sent a large force of soldiers and sailors to quash
      (defeat) the rebellion right away. The King also sent 20,000
      mercenaries (person who fights, kills for money) or Hessians
      (German auxiliaries contracted for military service) to America in
      order to suppress the rebellion.
    + This is the point when the colonists effectively gave up trying to
    reconcile with England and assumed the mantle of war against the
    mother country.

### Headlong into War

- The British sent General William Howe to head the British troops on an
attack against the Americans in Charlestown, MA, just outside of Boston.
    + They clashed in the Battle of Bunker (actually Breed's) Hill, with
    Captain William Prescott leading the American troops.
    + The British won the battle but lost devastating numbers of men.
    + The battle, however, boosted American morale because the
    unseasoned American troops were able to hold their own against the
    highly trained British troops.
- The Americans then surrounded the British army in Boston at Dorchester
Heights with cannons and mortars, which they had taken from Fort
Ticonderoga.
    + Former bookstore owner Henry Knox had joined the Patriots. He used
    oxen to pull the cannon from the fort to the outskirts of Boston.
    + During the night, the American soldiers worked quickly and
    quietly, packing the wheels of the cannons with straw as not to
    alert the sleeping British.
    + The next morning when the yawning British soldiers wandered
    outside, they were surprised to find that the wily Americans had
    surrounded Boston with bristling cannons.
    + The British then decided to evacuate Boston posthaste (quickly).
- In January, 1776, Britishh immigrant and printer Thomas Paine
published his pamphlet "Common Sense," which pleaded with American
colonists to fight for independence against a tyrannical king.
    + Paine argued that a political system was more efficient when
    politicians were elected by the nation's citizens.
    + Paine urged the Americans to declare independence, so the men
    already fighting for their country would have a cause to fight for.
    + He laughed at the idea that a pip-squeak island dared to control
    and subdue a vast continent.
    + He argued that the British extorted American wealth and suppressed
    the industry and growth of the American colonies.
    + He pleaded with the Americans to let the dying relationship
    between the colonies and the mother country go and embrace
    independent entity.
    + He also suggested that the Americans form a republic as a perfect
    form of government to preserve freedom.
    + He strongly promoted democracy, which Americans would slowly adopt
    after the Revolution.

### The Declaration of Independence

- Paine's influential pamphlet motivated many Americans to write their
representatives in Congress and push them to vote for independence.
- On July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress voted for Independence and
on July 4th Congress accepted the Declaration of Independence.
    + In the Declaration, the colonists rationalized their reparation
    from England with a legal list of their grievances.
    + Once the Americans declared themselves independent, they could
    claim sovereignty (authority to rule) as independent states and thus
    legitimately declare war, make foreign alliances, and trade with
    other countries.
    + Jefferson also argued the Americans' natural rights in the
    Declaration, which were Lockean liberal notions.
    + There is a paradox about the government's intent in this new
    political system: does it protect individual rights? Or, does it
    safeguard the public good? One must remember that the American
    founders feared social upheaval (great change), which they believed
    was occasioned by social equality. Democracy still represented
    anarchy (lawlessness, absence of government) to the founding
    fathers.

### Objectives

- The British objective in the American Revolution war to win battles
and quash the rebellion. They do not try to win back the loyalty of the
colonists, which is a big reason why they lose the war.
    + They seized major cities and ports, hoping to crush American
    morale and force them to sue for peace.
    + But, this failed to debilitate the American colonies because mot
    of the populace resided in the countryside and the loss of key
    cities such as New York and Philadelphia did not cripple the
    American cause.
    + When the British attempted to seize the capital of the newly born
    U.S.A. (Philadelphia), the Congress simply fled to Western
    Pennsylvania to run the government there.
- The American objective in the Revolution was not to win battles
necessarily, but to keep the army and the cause alive for the duration
of the war.
    + In European military engagements, it was common for a general to
    surrender if he lost a battle. But, Washington refused to surrender
    when the Americans lost battles. Instead, he would retreat and force
    the British to exhaust their men, supplies, and patience chasing
    after the American troops.
    + In the American Revolution, the British won most of the battles
    hands down. But, this war was not about military might. It was
    endurance and fortitude which won the war, and Washington deftly
    maintained the guerilla/Indian warfare against the British until the
    British Empire grew weary of the contest and gave Americans their
    desired independence. Washington did not beat the British, he
    outlasted (endure beyond another) them.

### Battles

- In 1776, Washington's continental army managed to drive the British
troops out of Boston. The British moved their troops to New York City
under the command of General William Howe.
    + Washington was outmaneuvered in the Battle of New York and was
    forced to retreat.
    + American morale at this time was very low because of the failure
    in this battle and thousands of American soldiers were taken
    prisoner and housed in fetid prison ships outside of Manhattan,
    where they died in droves.
    + Washington rallied morale when he successfully crossed the
    Delaware River in Dec of 1776 and surprised the Hessian forces in
    Trenton, NJ.
    + With the surrender of the Hessian general, Americans proved one
    more that they could hold their own in battle and take numerous men
    prison.
- In 1777, there was another great victory for the Americans. British
General Burgoyne "Gentleman Johnnie" was ordered to march his troops
down from the North (Montreal) and meet with GEneral Howe in New York
City, who was marching up from the South in order to cut New England
off.
    + The problem is that Howe does not march as ordered.
    + The Americans also frustrated Burgoyne's attempts by sniping at
    his forces as they marched through the wilderness and by cutting
    down tress in their path in order to slow their progress.
    + Meanwhile, Howe decided to take Philadelphia, where the
    Continental Congress was located. Washington attempted to defend
    Philadelphia, but was defeated in the Battle of Brandywine (Sept
    1777) and retreated to Valley Forge, PA for the winter.
    + Here, the Americans troops would be professionally trained by the
    Prussian Baron von Steuben, who taught them how to drill and wield
    weapons with deadly effect.
    + The Americans would later used this training to successfully
    defeat a major British army in Yorktown, VA and effectively win the
    war.
    + The Battle of Saratoga (Oct 1777) would be a significant
    development for the Americans: Burgoyne met the American forces
    under Horatio Gates and was decisively defeated. This is a major
    turning point in the war because King Louis XVI and France were
    persuaded to join the American cause in 1778.
    + The French wanted revenge against Britain for their losses in the
    French and Indian war and aiding the American colonist against their
    mother country gave the French the perfect opportunity.
    + France provided the Americans with supplies, munitions, soldieres,
    and a naval force. Without the French, it would have been immensely
    difficult for the Americans to win the war.
- In 1780/1781, General Henry Clinton was the commander in chief of the
British forces and he ordered Lord Cornwallis to conquer the southern
colonies, which were supposedly more loyal to the Crown.
    + Washington sent American General Greene down South to challenge
    Cornwallis.
    + Greene forced Cornwallis to chase him and the American army all
    over the Carolinas, which diminished Cornwallis's supplies.
    + Hence, Cornwallis retreated to Yorktown, VA in order to rest his
    men and wait for reinforcements by sea.
    + A British fleet came to relieve Cornwallis, but the French naval
    admiral Francois De Grasse cut the fleet off by blockading the
    Chesapeake by sea.
    + Then, Washington and French General Rochambeau marched south and
    cornered Cornwallis by land.
    + On Oct 19, 1781, Cornwallis surrendered to the French and American
    forces.
    + When the British troops marched out of the fort in order to lay
    down their weapons, they played a song called the "World Turned
    Upside Down." The reason was that a rag tag colonial force could
    effectively defeat the strongest military power in the world. The
    American played "Yankee Doodle," which was actually a song written
    by the British making fun of the colonists, calling them ignorant
    country bumpkins, who wished they could be sophisticated Britons.
    The Americans played this song for the obvious reason that they
    wanted to rub it in the faces of the British troops; namely, these
    country bumpkins just soundly defeated you!

### Peace

- In 1783, the Treaty of Paris ended the American Revolution with
American delegates (Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay)
presiding.
- The United States was awarded all the land up to the Mississippi.
- Britain, however, retained Canada.
- Florida went back to Spain.
- The Americans had prevailed in their trials for political
independence, but they faced a new challenge: the setting up of a
government which would hold the states together and uphold the promises
of freedom and equality.

## "I Bled in Battle, That You Might be Independent:" Did the Revolution Revolutionize the Lives of Women, Indians, and Black Slaves

### Multifaceted (having many different parts) Revolution

- Many different peoples fighting for different reasons and on different
sides.
    + There were Indian nations, such as the Iroquois Confederacy, which
    broke up their unions in order to fight on either the
    American/Patriot side or the British side.
    + There were loyalist and patriot women who braved the warfare and
    took over the business of the home while their husbands were
    fighting in the war.
    + There were also African American slaves who fought on both sides
    during the Revolution in hopes of winning their eventually freedom.
- Did the American founders provide for an induction of Native Americans
and African Americans in the new American Republic or American society?
Or, were the American founders racist? In other words was the Revolution
an exclusion or an inclusion of African Americans and Native Americans?
    + The founders' documents were visionary for their time.
    + It is unprofessional to judge a given era's standards and beliefs
    against the values of one's own era.
    + Professional historians must always strive to be objective, and
    they must always contextualize their subjects and judge them against
    their own era's values - not those of the current time.

### The Native Americans' Role

- What was the fate of the Native Americans after the Revolution?
    + The Native Americans were more likely to join with the Britain
    because of old political ties, trade connections, and the
    Proclamation of 1763 rather than join with the American colonists,
    who interminably encroached upon the Indians' land.
    + However, some Indians did take the side of the American Patriots.
    + The Iroquois Confederacy, which had persisted for hundreds of
    years and grown immensely powerful, split when Joseph Brant, and
    Mohawk Indian, decided to side with the British.
    + Most Indian tribes, however, attempted to stay neutral, as their
    communities were torn asunder due to conflicts over wartime policy.

### The USA's Indian Policy

- After the American Revolution had been won by the Patriots, the
Americans, who were intent on building their Republic, often would send
federal agents to the Indian tribes ini order to trick them into
incurring debt and swindle them out of their lands.
    + The American Republic was intended to be an Anglo American
    project, thus, that necessitated the movement west.
    + The Indians were perceived to be an obstacle to this movement and
    their lands were coveted.
    + Hence, the Indians were seen as a hindrance to the Republic and
    they were never perceived to be part of it.
    + The evidence that the founders never considered the Indians to be
    part of the Republic may be seen in the federal government's
    treaties with Indian nations: one only makes treaties with foreign
    nations - not with citizens of the same country.
    + Most Americans failed to recognize that the Indians had
    sophisticated governments of their own. But, not all of the founders
    saw the Indians as savages; some of them saw the Indians as quite
    sophisticated and complex. Yet, even these more open minded
    Americans still saw the Indians' culture as inferior and less
    evolved than their own.

### The American Plan for Indian Removal

- Thomas Jefferson subscribed to Jacques Rousseau's notion of Indians as
the "Noble Savage." Earlier on in Jefferson's career, he favored
assimilation (đồng hóa, absorption, the process of becoming similar to
others' culture) of Indians in American society, so long as the Indians
adopted civilization as modeled in the yeoman farmer.
    + The Indians would have to stop living communally and adopt the
    practice of private property - in other words, they would have to
    stop being Indian.
    + The Indians who refused to become civilized in Jefferson's view
    were barbarians (savage person) to be exterminated (killed).
    + Jefferson eventually came to see the Indians as obstacles to be
    pushed out of the way or extirpated once the United States obtained
    the Louisiana Purchase in 1803.
- By 1830, the Indians would be pushed beyond the Mississippi River to
make way for the American Republic.
- Even the Cherokee, who were farmers and salve owners; lived in towns
complete with schools and churches; and had their own alphabet, there
fore, meeting Jefferson's standards of civilization, were still stripped
of their land under Andrew Jackson's directive and moved West in the
early 19th century.
- The Constitution set Indians as separate nations, which is still how
  we view Indian nations today. The Revolution, thus, did not bode (to
  be a sign of something on the future) well for Native Americans.

### Black Slaves' Role

- What about the role of African American slaves in the American
Revolution?
- Slaves in New England and somewhat in the middle colonies usually
joined the side of the patriots (about 5,000), but most slaves in the
Chesapeake and in the Deep South joined the British, who proffered a
greater chance of freedom.
- In 1775, Virginian Royal Governor Lord Dunmore offered freedom to all
slaves and indentured servants who joined the British side. Nearly 9,000
slaves ran away from their colonial master and joined the British side
during the Revolution.

### Black Slaves' Place in the Republic

- What did the founders think about slavery? Did they see equality for
black Americans in the future? Were they that visionary?
- Most the founders mostly saw slavery as an economic necessity -
especially in the South where their market depended on it.
- Most of the founders like Thomas Jefferson could not imagine a world
without slaves and believed that if slavery ended, African Americans
would have to be completely separated from the white population.
- When Jefferson wrote in the Declaration that all men are created
equal, he meant that all men are born equal, but there are still
political, social, and economic inequalities which prevail.
- Thus, one cannot view the Revolution as a wholly utopian experiment
even though rhetoric intones it.
- The founders never wished to make everyone free and equal because
this would occasion social anarchy in their opinion.
- There was a diverse group of founders who opposed slavery and a group
who supported slavery.
- Whether the founders wished to end slavery or not, the slaves
appropriated the rhetoric of the Revolution and the Declaration in order
to avail their own needs. The founders never anticipated that the lower
classes and minorities would use their own rhetoric against the upper
white class in order to attain their own rights and liberties.

### Status of African Americans

- What was the status of African Americans?
- There were slaves, who were the property of their masters.
- There were some free blacks in America as well, who had been freed or
had been born free and owned themselves.
- There were Africans, who had recently been imported into the United
States.
- There were native born African Americans, who had created their own
cultural identity which mixed African and Anglo American culture.
- Even though there was a diversity of African cultures from different
parts of Africa, the fat remains that slavery and the forced inferiority
that came with it created a sense of solidarity among African Americans
of different cultures and statuses.

### The First Emancipation

- After the American Revolution, numerous slave owners took the
Revolution's rhetoric to heart and freed their slaves, so the number of
free blacks rose in America: up to 60,000 in 1790.
- Most Northern states gradually abolished slavery and upper Southern
states made emancipation easier.
- Some planters had switched to cultivating grain during the Revolution,
so they no loner were in need of many slaves.
- Most free blacks lived in the North, where they had more job
opportunities.
- Free blacks in the South created their own institutions such as
churches and schools. They also formed their own communities and
attempted to piece their families back together.
- Blacks especially used the rhetoric of liberty and equality in the
Revolution to petition for their freedom and the abolition of slavery.
They held slavery up as a blot on America's claims of freedom for all
men.

### The USA's Plan for Black Slaves

- However, even if blacks were freed, discrimination and racism still
prevailed against them in Southern and Northern society.
- They were not given the vote and they could not testify in court.
- They were relegated to menial jobs. Racism became more concretely
defined in the 18th century as predicated or based on skin color.
- Hence, revolutionary promises of equality and freedom applied
to whites, but not to reds, browns, and blacks.
- With the resulting solidarity among whites, the division between the
free vs. the unfree became a division between whites vs. colored.

### Women's Role

- How about women's role in the American Revolution?
- Women took an active part in the non-importation movements and they
usually ran the farm or household while their male relatives were
fighting in the war.
- Women also served as camp followers in the continental army, namely,
they were cooks, nurses, and launderers.
- A small number of women risked their lives and covertly fought in the
battles of the Revolution as soldiers.

### Republican Mothers

- After the Revolution, American stressed that all men be educated so
they could be able citizens in the Republic. Women, therefore, had to
receive a better education so they could instill virtuous republican
behavior in the republic's future citizens.
- Women became Republican Mothers and received a better education, but
they were never sent to college and they were not permitted to vote.
- Judith Sargent Murray argued that women had equal intellectual
capabilities as men, but the inadequate schooling they received made
them seem to be less intelligent.

### The USA's Plan for Women in the Republic

- Abigail Adams used the rhetoric of the Revolution in order to argue
for the reform of coverture laws, namely, laws where a woman's legal
identity and property was subsumed under her husband.
- She also reminded men, such as her own husband John Adams, to remember
that women expected their roles to be different after the Revolution.
However, women did not receive the vote and, thus, were still not
considered to be citizens in the Republic.
- They may received a better education, but they were still covered by
their husbands and were still in the same dependent category as were
children, servants, and slaves.
- They were expected to be good mothers and obedient wives. They were
also expected to be virtuous in the sense that they sacrifice their own
interests for the common good, but men were still allowed to pursue
self-interest in the economy and polity.

## "In Order to Form a More Perfect Union:" The Constitutional Convention of 1787 and the Battle over Ratification (enactment, approval) of the Constitution

### The Articles of Confederation (Union)

- After prevailing (current) in the eight-year War for Independence, the
Americans had achieved their political sovereignty; but, now they were
faced with the daunting task of setting up an entirely new government
based on the ideologies of the American Revolution.
- In the past, all historic republics (a government where the people
elect their leaders to rule for them) had decayed and collapsed into
absolutist (single leader, tyrant) governments. Greece and Rome stood as
a notorious example.
- The Americans, who were well versed (experienced) in the Classics,
were cognizant (aware) of the danger a republican government faced.
- The challenge confronting the American Founders was how do they set up
this government in order to sustain their republic?
    + Which was limited enough to permit its citizens to enjoy the
    individual liberties of freedom and equality, but which was also
    strong and centralized enough to provide the nation with order and
    security.
- The Americans had set up a provisional (temporary) government during
the American Revolution. The Articles of Confederation, which Congress
instituted in November of 1777, had only set up a loose confederacy of
states.
    + This government under the Articles had been maintained from 1777
      to 1787.
    + Under the Articles, the voters chose the state government and the
      state government chose the national government.
    + It consisted of a one house government, namely, it was a
      unicameral (having a single legislative chamber) government.
    + There was allowed only one vote per state and 3-7 delegates
      (representative) per state.
    + There was no president or Supreme Court, so this government only
      had one branch.
    + This government had very limited powers over the states because
      the Americans founders feared monarchy and the centralization of
      government, so a government that was too strong was a threat.
    + However, the government under the Articles really needed to tax
      the states in order to accrue (increase by addition or growth)
      badly needed revenue because the country was in terrible debt
      after the war, but Congress did not have the power to levy taxes
      on the states and it could not regulate trade.
    + The only powers the government had were to declare war, to draw
    boundaries, to engage in foreign diplomacy (the management of
    relationships between countries), and to make treaties with Indian
    nations.
    + This government proved to be too inept (inefficient) and feeble
    (weak) to lead the nation after the war.

### A State of Depression

- What did the American economy look like after the war?
    + The United States economy was in crippling debt and its market was
      inundated (overwhelm) or flooded with English goods.
    + The government under the Articles of Confederation had overprinted
      paper money, so currency was suffering from depreciation
      (devaluation).
    + The Continental dollar had been reduced to being worthless before
      the end of the war hence the saying, "Not worth a continental."
    + To add insult to injury, other countries refused to trade with the
      United States because of her low credit.
- Immediately after the war, all of the states were preoccupied with
  drafting their own state constitutions.
- Individuals in the respective states were also scrambling to salvage
  (rescue) their own financial affairs, so the states were turning more
  inward.
- Each state was concerned solely with protecting itself economically,
  namely, local markets for local businesses took precedence.
- In this state of affairs, the Congress under the Articles was largely
  an ignored entity.

### The Call for a Stronger Government

- In response to this deplorable (unfortunate) condition, some
  individuals, such as Alexander Hamilton, sought to reform this inert
  (lifeless) national government in favor of a strong, centralized
  government.
    + Hamilton was also determined to make the United States an affluent
      (wealthy) or rich industrial/manufacturing nation, so it could
      compete with the European nations economically.
    + George Washington also wanted a stronger government, so he sent a
      circular (a letter or notice) around the states highlighting the
      problems of the current feeble government.
- Shay's Rebellion (1786) proved to be the catalyst (a condition, event,
  or person that is the cause of an important change) for the
  Constitutional Convention as well.
    + Daniel Shays had fought in the Revolution and had returned to his
    farm in Massachusetts, where farmers were being heavily taxed in
    order to pay off the state debts and were being arrested if they
    could not pay. These farmers responded to this undesirable tax as
    they had in the Revolution: they attacked the armory in Springfield
    and tried to take down the Massachusetts government because they
    believed that it had failed them.
    + Shay's rebellion frightened the American founders because they
    knew that without a strong central government, the social anarchy
    which was exhibited in Shay's Rebellion would grip the young United
    States.

### The Constitutional Convention

- Provoked by Shay's Rebellion to take the condition of the current
government seriously, the delegates who met at the Constitutional
Convention in Philadelphia during 1787 were instructed to reform the
Articles of Confederation.
- The Continental Congress decided to jettison the Articles and create
an entirely new government. Fifty-five delegates showed up in
Philadelphia and stayed 17 weeks in order to hammer out the government
and to write the Constitution.
- The delegates were mostly over the age of 30 and constituted the
educated elite.
- Who was conspicuously (apparently) absent from the Convention?: Thomas
  Jefferson (ambassador in France), John Adams (ambassador in London),
  Samuel Adams (Not chosen due to his radicalism), and Patrick Henry
  (who refused to attend; he reportedly commented that he "smelled a
  rat").
- Who was conspicuously present at the Convention?: Alexander Hamilton,
George Mason, James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, and George Washington.
- James Madison is considered to be the "Father of the Constitution"
because he directed much of the course taken in constructing the
government. He studied all forms of government extensively (widely) and
he took copious (abundant) notes during the Convention.
- The Convention was a closed meeting and the delegates took a vote of
secrecy. Fortunately, we know a lot about the proceeding in the
Convention due to Madison's journals.

### Issues to Deliberate (discuss)

- The main issues of the Convention were the centralization of authority
and the economic future of the United States.
- Two groups would evolve out of the Convention:
    + The Federalists were the nationalists, who subsumed state identity
      in favor of uniformity and centralized federal control;
    + The Anti-federalists, who were concerned that too much authority
      in the hands of a centralized government and the elite would
      result in the loss of individual's rights. The Anti-federalists
      also worried that a large government would not be able to
      acknowledge the respective interests of the states and the people.

### Proposed Plans

- There were also several plans proposed revolving around the issue of
representation between the large states and the small states.
- The First Plan:
    + The Virginia Plan involved a bicameral government (two houses);
    + Separating powers of governance (executive, judiciary, and
    legislative) called checks and balances.
    + The division of powers between the nation and the states called
    federalism; and mandated that all the state representatives allowed
    in Congress would be proportionate to the respective state's
    population.
- The Second Plan:
    + The New Jersey Plan included a bicameral government and mandated
    that each state would receive two state representatives for the
    house and two representatives for the senate no matter the
    respective state's population.
- The resulting deadlock necessitated compromises.

### Compromises

- The Constitution was founded on three compromises.
- The First Compromise:
    + The Great Compromise held that the senate gets two representatives
      from each state no matter the state's population.
    + The House's representatives would be proportional to the
      respective state's population.
    + This alleviated (relieved) the issue of representation between the
      large and small states.
- The Second Compromise:
    + The Three-fifths Compromise held that 3/5ths of the slave
      population in each state would be counted towards the state's
      representation in the House
    + In some Southern states, the black population outnumbered the
      white population, which posed a problem for the Southern states
      should only the white population be counted toward Southern
      representation in Congress.
    + So, the 3/5ths Compromise allowed Southerners to include the black
      population, so they could have more representatives in Congress.
- The Third Compromise:
    + The South wanted to be able to freely export their commodities,
    but the North also wanted Navigation Acts.
    + The compromise between the two regions held that the South must
    accept the Navigation Acts, but the North had to accept the slave
    trade until its final end in 1808.

### The New Stronger Government

- Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power
it had lacked under the Articles; namely, Congress now had the power to
tax the states and regulate trade.
    + It also conferred (granted) with the power to create a national
      currency.
- Within the Judiciary Branch, the Supreme Court was set up as the
highest court in the U.S. Article II of the Constitution established the
Executive Branch, or the presidency.
    + Under the Constitution, the president was chosen by state
    governments.
    + The first president under the Constitution was George Washington,
    who was unanimously elected.
- A bicameral Congress (2 houses) was set up based on direct and
indirect methods of election:
    + The House of Representative was directed by the people.
    + The Senate indirectly by the state governments.
- There is, thus, a balance between the elite and the common people in
the U.S. government.

### Ratification of the Constitution

- After the founders had argued out the structure of the new government
and composed the Constitution, they still had to persuade the States to
ratify the Constitution and make it the law of the land.
- The Federalists, such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, argued
for the immediate ratification of the Constitution by the States in
order to protect the Nation.
    + They argued that the Constitution's checks and balances and the
    separation of powers between the States and the Nation (Federalism)
    effectively eliminated corruption and tyranny in the government.
- The Anti-federalists, however, were not convinced. The Anti-
  federalists, such as Patrick Henry and George Mason, feared that a
  strong national government would not protect the liberties of the
  people and only the States could safeguard the people's rights.
    + The Anti-federalists did not want to ratify the Constitution until
    a Bill of Rights, which protected individual's rights, was added to
    the Constitution lest the government lose it allegiance to the
    people.
    + The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution in 1791 and is
    considered to be the most important part of the U.S. Constitution.

### The Majority vs. the Minority

- The Anti-federalists also demanded that the Constitution be ever open
to amendment in order to protect against governmental corruption.
    + They feared that a vast nation could not have a functioning
    virtuous republic.
- But, James Madison argued that despite previous beliefs, small
republics in history had failed because they were too small, factional,
and homogeneous. The United States' republic, however, would be diverse
and expansive. Divisive factions could never get a strong handhold in
this republic because the United States boasted a diversity of competing
interests, so no one power could dominate.
- Madison's argument was very astute (very sharp and well thought) and
ahead of its time.

### The American Republic

- Nine states were needed in order to ratify the Constitution.
    + Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote the
    *Federalist Papers* in order to explain the principle of checks and
    balances in the new federal government and, thereby, convince the
    States to ratify the Constitution
- Unfortunately, the Constitution excluded the voice or vote of the poor
and minorities such as women, blacks, and Indians.
    + The United States was never intended to be set up as a mass
    democracy.
    + The American Founders intended to set up an elite government, but
    the government would become more democratic with the inclusion of
    western states and its values would transition.
    + Also, minorities and the poor would appropriate the rhetoric of
    the Revolution in order to argue for their own rights and make the
    government more democratic, which the American Founders never
    anticipated (expected).
    + This is the genius of the U.S. Constitution: it is explicit enough
    to afford security and order to the National government, but it is
    also flexible and open to growth and a shift in values between
    generations. Because of this, the U.S. Constitution is the oldest
    Constitution still effectively functioning in the world.

## "The Baneful (harmful) Effects of the Spirit of Party:" Alexander Hamilton vs. Thomas Jefferson in the Formation of American Political Parties and the Political Course of the Nation

### Politics in the Early Republic

- The American founders had achieved their goal of structuring a stable,
  centralized American republic, but the next two decades of political
  strife (struggle) (both domestically and internationally) would sorely
  test this young republic's endurance.
- The American founders were initially opposed to the notion of
political parties because they considered them to be divisive factions.
    + The founders distrusted political parties because political
    parties only served their own particular interests instead of
    catering to the common good of the republic.
    + Political parties, thus, were dangerous to republics and a sign
    that government was becoming corrupt.
    + In the ideal republic, a good political leader was not the head of
    a party or faction, but was rather a disinterested leader beholden
    only to public service and the welfare of the common good. He would
    never try to promote himself in a campaign, but rather if he was a
    true republican, he would stay out of campaigning and selflessly
    answer his country's call if he was needed to serve.
    + George Washington especially exemplified (to be a typical
    example) this prevalent belief when he resignedly accepted his post
    as the first president of the United States of America.

### The Federalists: the Nationalists

- But, politics rapidly changed during the Early Republic and political
parties quickly took their place in the form of the Federalist and the
Democratic-Republican parties.
- The Federalists under party leader Alexander Hamilton, as we have
seen, did not want the states to have too much power, but rather they
stressed that the centralized, federal government must be predominate.
- Because the U.S.A. was suffering from a lot of debt after the American
Revolution, Hamilton proposed three reports in order to solve the
U.S.A.'s financial and economic problems:
    1) Public Credit (combine all thirteen state debts into one big
    debt)
    2) National Banking Structure
    3) Domestic Manufacturing
- Hamilton was a pragmatist (approach to problems based on practical
solutions), a unionist, and an abolitionist (who support an end to
slavery).

### Federalist Policies

1. USA priority according to the Federalists: a strong, central
government is essential and disunion is to be resisted at all costs
2. Federalist belief in political participation: limited electoral based
on propertied, elite class - a type of oligarchy
3. Federalist Constitutional interpretations: a loose interpretation of
the Constitution's limits also known as the "elastic clause"
4. Federalist vision of America's future: develop an industrial
manufacturing base in order to release the U.S.A. from economic
dependence on Britain's protective tariff policy.

### The Democrat-Republicans: States' Rights

- The Democratic-Republicans under party leader Thomas Jefferson sought
to preserve the rights of the individual States and believed that the
States should reserve their powers away from the federal government.
- They believed that the States were the best protectors of the people's
liberties and a safeguard from the rise of a corrupt centralized
government.
- Jefferson believed that the federal and state governments should have
no role in enforcing religious beliefs.
- He also believed that a clear separation of church and state was
necessary because if they were joined, the two institutions could more
easily coerce individuals to take a certain political or religious
stance.
- Jefferson was not an atheist, but rather, he was a deist and a
rationalist. Unlike Hamilton, Jefferson was also an idealist and a
populist.

### Democratic-Republican Policies

1. USA priority according to the Democratic-Republicans: they advocated
States' rights and resisted both political and economic monopolies
2. Democratic-Republican belief in political participation: voting
rights should be expanded to the common man, so they are populists
3. Democratic-Republican Constitutional interpretations: they endorsed a
strict 10th Amendment, which mandates that the powers not delegated to
the federal government under the Constitution are reserved to the States
and the people; also, the Constitution should only be strictly
interpreted with no poetic license
4. Democratic-Republican vision of America's future: they were primarily
agrarian (supportive of an agricultural country) and they were
Anti-British Industrial Revolution, as they had an aesthetic objection
to manufacturing. They were typically supportive of slave labor and
actually believed that waged labor subverts (destroys) liberty.

### Political Factions

- Both sides continually accused the other of going against the ideals
of the American Revolution and of trying to compromise or destroy the
American republic.
    + The Democratic-Republicans accused the Federalists of being too
    aristocratic and even of plotting to institute a monarchy on the
    example of England.
    + The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of trying to
    undermine (weaken) the Constitution and even labeled them as
    dangerous rabble (mob).
- In 1789, the onset of the French Revolution divided the political
  parties even more and fostered quite a bit of contempt (disrespect) in
  the domestic political scene.
    + The Democratic-Republicans favored the French Revolutionaries and
    argued that the U.S.A. should support the French Revolution under
    the terms of alliance with France made in 1778. They saw the French
    Revolution as a sign that the American experiment of liberty had
    inspired the people of Europe to revolt and topple their autocratic
    monarchies and to institute governments which safeguarded their
    citizens' natural rights.
    + The Federalists, however, argued that the French REvolution was a
      perversion of republicanism and the bloody anarchy of the enraged
      rabble. They also contended that the U.S.A. had made its alliance
      terms under the French monarchy; so, since the French had
      guillotined (executed) their king in 1793, the obligation of the
      U.S.A. to France was no longer binding.
- Where the Democratic-Republicans were pro-French, the Federalists were
more pro-British because the USA's economy was still dependent on
England's manufactured goods.

### American Neutrality

- Despite the Federalists' and Democratic-Republicans' Anglo and French
leanings, the U.S.A. under President George Washington took a newtral
stance during the French REvolution because the U.S.A. would not gain
anything if France won and she would lose everything if France lost.
    + Washington was aware that the U.S.A. was a young country and
      desperately needed to stay out of European conflicts and
      entanglements if she was to strengthen herself as a nation and
      force Europe to see her as a sovereign political entity.
    + In other words, America was just a baby as nations go and
      Washington stressed that if America became involved in England and
      France's intermittent wars, she would be strangled in the cradle
      politically. It was best to keep to her own and stay neutral; this
      is the policy that America would follow until she entered WWI.
- Jay's Treaty (1795) also engendered (caused) quite a bit of heat in
  the American political scene: John Jay was a Federalist, who was sent
  by Washington to London in order to negotiate a treaty with England
  that the U.S.A. would remain neutral in the war between England and
  France. Hence, American merchant ships were not to be seized at sea.
    + Democratic-Republicans hit the roof when they got wind of Jay's
    Treaty because they saw it as a sign of Federalist duplicity with
    the former British enemies against the French.
    + The French responded to Jay's treaty by attacking American ships
    carrying British goods at sea. This initiated the Quasi-War between
    France and the U.S.A. (1796-1800): American sailors were being taken
    prisoner by French ships. President John Adams responded by creating
    an American navy, which sailed into the West Indies and captured
    French sailors in order to trade for American prisoners. The
    American navy secured American shores by 1799.
- Peace with France was negotiated in 1800 under Emperor Napoleon
Bonaparte.
    + Napoleon had overthrown the revolutionary authorities in France
    and the Directory was currently running as the new French
    government.
    + Napoleon agreed that the USA should remain neutral, which freed
    the U.S.A. from its obligations to France under the 1778 alliance
    treaty and finally allowed the U.S.A. to develop independently
    without any European entanglements.
- Now that America was free of European military pressures, she directed
  her attention to the beckoning land of milk and honey, the American
  West.

### The Louisiana Purchase

- In 1801, Napoleon pushed the Spanish to give their Louisiana territory
in North America to France.
- Thomas Jefferson became president in 1801 and was very wary of the
presence of French rule under Napoleon to the west of the American
nation.
    + He sent a delegate to Napoleon in order to negotiate that the
    Americans may have access to the mouth of the Mississippi River for
    commercial purposes and even to purchase the city of New Orleans if
    possible.
    + Napoleon surprised the Americans by deciding to sell all of the
    Louisiana territory to the USA. Napoleon made this unilateral
    decision because he needed money to fight in the war against
    England. He also sold the land to the USA because a successful slave
    rebellion in Haiti led by Touissant L'ouuerture (becomes an African
    state) convinced Napoleon that it was not worth keeping the land.
    + The USA under Jefferson happily buys all of the Louisiana
    territory, which averages 827,000 miles for the price of fifteen
    million. So in 1803, the Louisiana Purchase doubled the territory of
    the American nation, which makes it a very important purchase in
    American history.
- This is very Hamiltonian move that Jefferson took (Jefferson as
  president didn't really have the authority as president to make the
  purchase unless one interprets the Constitution loosely) and it won
  instant popularity for his administration.
- Jefferson, the enthusiastic man of the enlightenment, wasted no time
  in sending Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on a scientific
  exploration (1804-1806) of the newly obtained land with the goal of
  reaching the Pacific Ocean and exploring the landscape and its
  inhabitants.

### The War of 1812

- In the War of 1812 (1812-1814), the U.S. Congress declared war on
Great Britain. Why?
    + Congress claimed that it was due to the British showed blatant
    disrespect of the US as a sovereign nation.
    + But, the USA also declared war on England because she had designs
    on British Canada, which she desired to make part of the American
    nation due to Canada's immense wealth of natural resources.
    + Lastly, Americans living on the Western frontier accused the
    Britain, who still had not evacuated western forts, of enticing
    Indians to attacks American settlements.

### War of 1812 Continued

- In 1813, the Americans attacked Canada and sacked York (today's
Toronto) the capital of British Canada.
- In 1814, Napoleon's massive army was weakened by its failure to take
  Moscow, Russia. The French army was summarily defeated by Great
  Britain and Napoleon was taken prisoner. Britain now could focus its
  attention on sending forces to the USA in order to avenge the American
  sacking of York.
    + British soldiers invaded the poorly defended American capital,
    Washington D.C., and burned the American congressional building and
    the presidential mansion to the ground.
    + The Americans were caught completely unprepared and were forced to
    evacuate their own capital, which showed the USA's military
    vulnerability.
    + In the resolution of this war, no side gained land or lost land in
    the Treaty of Ghent (Dec 24). However, news of the treaty took two
    weeks to reach the USA and British forces attacked New Orleans
    because they did not know the war was over. The Battle of New
    Orleans was a resounding victory for the USA under General Andrew
    Jackson, who became a major war hero and later, a US president.

### Peace and Domestic Growth

- In 1815, the British defeated Napoleon at Waterloo and there would be
peace in Europe for 99 years, which was great news for the USA because
the Americans could now focus on making sure that their nation could
grow domestically as a strong, independent country.
- In the Adams-Onis Treaty (1819), the US acquired Florida from Spain.
Spain was dealing with multiple revolutions in Latin America and it
could no longer hold on to Florida. So, Spain sold Florida to the USA so
long as the USA promised to never try to take California and Texas from
Spain.
- In the Monroe Doctrine (1823), the USA informed Europe that the
Western HEmisphere was now in the in the province or jurisdiction of the
US and mandated that Europe must stay out of the US affairs.
    + This is very important because the USA asserted itself as a
    sovereign nation and affirmed that there would be no more
    colonization by European powers in the Western Hemisphere.
    + The USA, thus, reserved North America for herself. This also
    effectively closes off foreign policy in the USA for some time.

### Significance of These Events

- What is the historical significance of the Louisiana Purchase and the
War of 1812?
- First of all, the Federalist Party loses its influence on the national
scene.
    + It becomes unpopular because a Federalist faction threatened to
      separate New England from the American Union in opposition to the
      war against England.
    + Most Americans also felt that the Federalists were out of touch
    with the trust invested in the American people and the direction of
    the nation toward a more expansive democracy.
    + After the War of 1812, the Federalist Party ceased to have
    political influence and dissolved as a party.
- Second, domestic industry and manufacturing was accelerated during the
War of 1812, for New England and the Middle States were forced to lean
on domestic industry due to the British navy blockade, which cut off
foreign commercial imports to America.
- Third, the USA affirmed its sovereignty as an independent republic to
all of Europe and grew rapidly as a strong, industrious nation.
- Lastly (fourth), the INdians who were allied with the British during
the War of 1812 lost their land, which opened up the land for
Anglo-American westward expansion and the pivotal movement of slavery
west.

## "The Market Revolution:" Industrialization, Urbanization, and the American Character in the Antebellum Period

### American Democracy

- The British had blockaded the American East Coast during the War of
1812 in order to obstruct any commercial goods from going in or out of
the U.S. with the intent of economically strangling the U.S. into
conceding (admitting) the war.
    + The northern states made their own goods for domestic use.
    + One of the effects of the British blockade was that it encouraged
    the rise of domestic manufacturing and industry in the American
    Northern states.
    + The British unintentionally helped to jump start
    industrialization, urbanization, and commercialization in the North,
    which would quickly culminate the "Market Revolution."
    + This revolution of sorts would distinguish the American North from
    the American South in terms of its structural makeup and its
    defining culture; so we can see that the two regions are already
    growing steadily apart, which will eventually lead us down into the
    Civil War.
- This is also the period when the U.S. became gradually more
democratic. With that being said, what then are all the components of a
democracy:
    + (1) Government is based on the rule of the people and by the
    people;
    + (2) debate is the ideal instead of war;
    + (3) majority rule;
    + (4) an openness to dissent or a tolerance of difference;
    + (5) the right to choose or depose political leaders
    (republicanism);
    + (6) a free market or open economic competition (capitalism);
    + (7) individual's civil rights are protected;
    + (8) and the notion of equal rights and equal opportunity is
    emphasized.
- This new American Democracy will be solely tested during the
Antebellum Period and especially during the Civil War Period with the
secession (separation) of the Southern States.

### The Market Revolution

- The Market Revolution completely revolutionized the way Americans
lived their everyday lives.
- Due to the Market Revolution, the Northern people would no longer
primarily produce food or goods for self-sufficiency, but rather, they
would produce a surplus (extra) for the market, so they could make more
money, so they could in turn buy more goods.
- They sold their surplus crops to merchants, so they could buy luxuries
and goods they otherwise would have had to make.
- Within the Market Revolution, there was a transportation revolution
and a communication revolution.

### The Transportation Revolution

- The transportation revolution started in the early nineteenth-century.
    + In 1807, Robert Fulton invented the steam boat and the Mississippi
    River became the major artery for commercial and travel purposes in
    the U.S. Scores (numbers) of Americans would quickly move up and
    down the Mississippi River due to the effectiveness of the steam
    boat; travel down the river went from months before the invention of
    the invention of the steam boat to a matter of days.
    + A National Road from Maryland to Illinois was also built in 1808.
    These roads helped to connect distant locals into a united nation.
    + From 1800 to 1825, workers diligently worked on the Erie Canal
    (324 miles long), which connected Albany, New York to Buffalo, New
    York, thereby (by that) creating a link from Chicago to the East and
    jumpstarting the tourist industry. Goods from the East that would
    take months to reach westerners before the canal was built now took
    a few weeks. The canal also connected the West to the East, thereby
    creating a more unified national identity. It also employed
    thousands of workers.
    + In 1830, the Railroads had already 31,000 miles of track laid down
    mostly in New England and the Northwest, thereby facilitating travel
    and uniting the different regions of the country. Most of the track
    would be laid in the North, which would greatly benefit this region
    during the Civil War against the American South.

### The Communication Revolution

- The communication revolution started with Samuel Morse's invention of
the electrical telegraph in 1844. By 1848, telegraph lines connected New
York City to Charleston, South Carolina.
- Food diets also become more varied during this period.
- Mobility of people increased, which made the economy improve and
social standing rise.
- There was also more cultural interaction due to the dynamic
international market.
- Information exchange was also on the rise.
- Capital investments increased due to the rise in transportation. More
jobs were needed during the market revolution, so the country opened up
to an influx of German and Irish immigrants in order to satisfy the
labor demand.
- A concrete national identity began to form now that America was a more
unified country due to its transportation and communication revolutions.
- More states were being formed and introduced to the nation due to the
movement west of footloose settlers, and with each addition of western
territory, the young country became more and more democratic.

### Industrialization

- Industrialization also notably comes into its own during this period.
- Before the industrial revolution, apprenticeship was the means of
learning a trade. One would leave home and live with his master, who
would teach him a skill such as shoemaking or printing.
- Home manufacture was also more prevalent, where textiles (cloth or
clothing) were made at home by women and sent to merchants who sold
them on the market.
- Most people worked at home before the Market Revolution. This would
all change during the industrial revolution when "manufactories,"
which was later shortened to just "factories," brought all workers and
their labor under one roof.
- In 1789, England had already industrialized and jealously protected
its secrets, but an Englishman named Samuel Slater surreptitiously
(sneakily) memorized the blueprints of an industrial factory in England
and brought them to America, where be build Slater's Mill. This was the
first American factory.
- The first factories in America consisted of textile (cloth) factories.
Southern cotton was sent to Northern textile factories, where it was
manufactured into cloth.
- Hence, we can see that the North did have an implicit hand in Southern
slavery and many northern businessmen saw no reason to end the
institution in the South.
- Lowell Mill, Massachusetts became the site of the first industrial
labor strike in 1834 to 1836 because the female textile workers argued
that they were being worked like slaves - they worked an astonishing
fourteen hours a day!
- Before the industrial revolution, people worked according to daily
cycles of sunlight and in accordance with the seasons. There were
periods of extensive work during the year, such as during harvest, but
there were also periods of rest and relaxation, such as during the
winter. However, with the coming of the industrial revolution, the
"tyranny of the clock" began to run people's lives and change the manner
in which they worked. Schedules become paramount (superior) and people
were forced to abide by them lest (for fear that) they lose their job.
Work days were now long and year round.
- With the move of labor into factories, people lost a defining sense
of personal independence and a sense of mastery and pride in their work.
Long hours, low wages, and dangerous conditions plagued these factory
workers.
- The railroads also reflected this change of time in that they start to
run on strict schedules and time zones come into their own.

### Commercialization

- Before the Market Revolution, the barter system prevailed, which is
where goods are exchanged for goods. Formal specie (gold or silver
coins) or cash was not necessarily needed as tender in a purchase.
However, during the Market Revolution, the cash system, which is where
money is exchanged for goods, took root and became the dominant system.
- People learned that they must work for cash, so they can purchase new
goods at the market in order to make their lives more comfortable.
Hence, there was a mass production of goods and specialization of
agriculture to serve the market in the North.

### Urbanization

- Urbanization also comes into its own during the Market Revolution
because people were flocking to American cities, where there was a high
demand for cheap labor.
- In 1820, 7% of Americans lived in cities. In 1860, 20% of Americans
lived in cities.
- Those flocking to the cities were either rural migrants or
foreign immigrants. In 1820, 1.6% of city residents were immigrants. In
1860, 11.2% of residents were immigrants (mostly Irish and German).
- Immigrants faced difficult and dangerous working conditions in the
factories and blatant racism in the cities.
- Cities pose a conflicting symbolism in American history: on one hand,
they represent the success of civilization and the spread of culture;
but on the other hand, they represent corruption, filth, vice, sin,
crime, and disease.
- In the cities of the Early Republic, there was no garbage disposal and
the sanitation of the water supply was very poor, which led to outbreaks
of water borne disease such as yellow fever and cholera.

### The American Character

- The American character was explicated fully by Alexis Tocqueville in
his book Democracy in America. By 1850, foreign observers, such as
Tocqueville, could note a distinct and definable American character that
differed from European culture.
- As you know, the American identity had been congealing (thickening)
since the 17th century due to the interaction of European, African, and
Native American culture. THe glimmerings of a separate American identity
became evident in the Revolutionary period, but it was not until the
19th century that it finally blossomed into a distinct character with
distinguishing traits that Americans did (and somewhat still do!)
exhibit.

### American Characteristics

- The newly developed American characters:
    + (1) Materialism: Americans  continually and without fear of risk
    chased wealth in order to elevate their social status. Americans
    equated success and wealth with virtue and correlated poverty with
    immorality. They invariably sought to buy more and more goods from
    the market in order to improve and ease their domestic lives.
    + (2) Anti-intellectualism: in the democratic climate, Americans
    came to champion the street smart, quick-witted business common man
    and were now opposed to the elite, erudite (well-educated) scholar.
    + (3) Optimism: Americans were predominately future orientated and
    notably innovative in their society. In the Revolutionary period,
    individuals noted the rise and fall of empires, but in the
    Antebellum period, Americans saw history and time as progressive and
    linear. Most Americans looked at the future with high hopes and
    believed that their children would live better lives than their own.
    The movement of settlers west also represents this opportunity and
    hopeful optimism.
    + (4) Individualism: industrialization and the rise of factories
    occasioned aloofness (detachment) between people with less
    interaction in the community and more stress on the nuclear family.
    In this new industrial society, self-reliance and autonomy
    (independence) was celebrated and dependence scorned.
    + (5) Restlessness (constant motion): Americans were very footloose
    (free) during this period. The population doubled from 10 million
    in 1820 to 23 million in 1850, and 90% of the population moved
    within ten years. As noted before, land and movement equaled
    freedom in America, so Americans were distinct from Europeans in
    terms of their wanderlust (travel). Nine new states were added to
    Union as Americans expanded west and formed western territories.
    In America, all was hurried energy and frantic enterprise.
    + (6) Equality: there was a paradox between the talk of equality and
    the competition for wealth in America, which is itself creates
    inequality. There are equaity in the right to vote, as universal
    male suffrage had been implemented in the 1790s, but only white male
    adults could vote. By 1840, 90% of white men could vote regardless
    of their social status. American society was still unequal if one
    considers the condition of women, African Americans, and Native
    Americans, but there was a rough equality between white men in
    American society, which did not exit in class obsessed Europe.
    + (7) Social customs: tobacco chewing, smoking, and drinking were
    open to all classes in America. There were fewer class
    accommodations on railroads and steamboats, which scandalized class
    conscious Europeans - gender and racial segregation was more
    prevalent than social segregation in American transportation.
    Americans wore more universal clothing (no social prohibition on
    clothing) and shook hands with strangers.

### "Rags to Riches" - Poor to becoming rich

- All of this scandalized (offend) European visitors, but America still
had a growing disparity between the rich and poor.
- The "rags to riches"  narrative was largely not historically accurate,
as only 2% of the wealthiest citizens were born poor. But, Americans
still had faith in the notion of equal opportunity and the ideal that
one can improve their social standing.

### Distinctive Regions

- The North and South shared the same political ideology and history,
language, religion, and optimism in the American future.
    + The South, however, was more rural and focused on agriculture; was
      not biracial; and a lower populations; and was less developed in
      factories, transportation, schools, and churches.
    + The North was more urbanized, had a higher population, had more
    diversity of races due to immigration, and was highly developed in
    industry, transportation, and social institutions.
- The biggest difference between the two regions, however, was that the
North was a society with slaves but dependent on free waged labor, and
the South was a slave society, namely, it was wholly dependent on slave
labor.
- This growing regional divide between the South and the North would
catapult the nation into war and sorely test the young nation's
commitment to democracy.
