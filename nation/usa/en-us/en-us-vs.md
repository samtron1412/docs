# besides vs besides that
You can use both "besides" and besides that", but they have different meanings.

"Besides" means "addition to" and you can use it in a sentence like : "Television can educate us besides entertaining us." You can also use it to connect two sentences. e.g. "Walking in the park is really fun. Besides, it's good for our health." Here, it also means "also".

"Besides that" means "in addition to that". You use it to refer to something after having mentioned it before, e.g. "She likes studying, but has other interests besides that." where "that" refers to "studying".

You can also use this expression to connect two sentences, e.g. "If you like nature, you must visit our National Park in Pahang. Besides that, there are other National Parks in different parts of the country, especially East Malaysia." Here, "that" refers to "our National Park in Pahang". You can also use "besides those/these/this" where appropriate.

# Lie vs Lay

# Who am I? or Who I am
Sitting at the end of the stairs, sobbing, having lost my love, career and self-respect, I say to myself, "Who AM I? What is the purpose of my life?" See, here it is a question. That's why helping verb (am) is coming before the subject (I).

I ask myself who I am. Here, it is not a question, a mere narration of what I ask myself. So, it is not ending in question mark, plus, helping verb is after the subject.

- Who am I? : **this is a question**
- Who I am : **this isn't a question**

# Was vs. Were

# What happened - What's happened - What's happening - What's going on
**What happened?**: simple past tense, use to say about something in the past

**What's happened?**: "what has happened" present perfect tense, something happen in the past until now

**What's happening?**: "what is happening" present progressive tense, something happening

# let's, let and lets
- let: to allow or to permit
- lets: the third person singular present tense form
- let's equal "let us"

# how are you ? vs how have you been ?
- **How have you been ?** is usually used to greet someone whom you haven't seen for a while, I would say more than few weeks. And it expects a detailed answer.
- **How are you ?** is not expect a detailed answer - I'm fine, thanks; I'm OK; I'm good

# Perhaps vs. Maybe vs May be vs. Probably
**Perhaps/Maybe** - is used when something or someone is uncertain or not sure (40% - 60% chance)
- I am going to the beach this weekend perhaps/maybe you can come with me.
- Maybe/Perhaps we will see you at the party.
- We really want a car maybe/perhaps will buy a car.
- There were maybe/perhaps a hundred people at the party last night.

**Probably** - means that there is a good chance of something happening (70% - 95% chance)
- I am probably going to the beach this weekend.
- It is probably going to rain on Saturday.

**Maybe** is an adverb that means "possibly, perhaps." It is used with verbs

**May be** is made up of two verbs (the helping verb may and the infinitive be) which together refer to a possibility. They are not used with another verb.

> The meanings of maybe and may be are similar; the different uses are grammatical. Maybe must be used with or in response to a verb, whereas may be is a set of two verbs.
