# Adjectives

- We use adjectives to describe nouns.
- Most adjectives can be used in front of a noun:

> They have a **beautiful** house.
> We saw a very **exciting** film last night.

or after a link verb like be, look or feel:

> Their house is **beautiful**.
> That film looks **interesting**.

## Noun modifiers

- We often use two nouns together to show that one thing is a part of
  something else:

>the village church; the car door; the kitchen window; the chair leg;
my coat pocket; London residents

- We can use noun modifiers to show what something is made of:

> a gold watch; a leather purse; a metal box

- We often use noun modifiers with nouns ending in `-er` and `-ing`:

> an office worker; a jewellery maker; a potato peeler; a shopping list;
> a swimming lesson; a walking holiday.

- We use measurements, **age** or **value** as noun modifiers:

> a thirty kilogram suitcase; a two minute rest; a five thousand euro
> platinum watch; a fifty kilometre journey;

- We often put two nouns together and readers/listeners have work out
  what they mean. So:

> an ice bucket = a bucket to keep ice in
an ice cube = a cube made of ice
an ice breaker = a ship which breaks ice
the ice age = the time when much of the Earth was covered in ice.

- Sometimes we find more than two nouns together:

> London office workers; grammar practice exercises

- Noun modifiers come after adjectives:

> The old newspaper seller
A tiring fifty kilometre journey
