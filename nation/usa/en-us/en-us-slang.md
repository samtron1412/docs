language. It is used by people who belong to a particular group, such as
young people or criminals.

# NSFW
Not safe/suitable for work (NSFW) is Internet slang or shorthand.
Typically, the NSFW tag is used in e-mail, videos, and on interactive
discussion areas (such as Internet forums, blogs, or community websites)
to mark URLs or hyperlinks which contain material such as nudity,
pornography, or profanity, which the viewer may not want it to be seen
accessing in a public or formal setting such as in a workplace.
