# Overview
A terminal multiplexer is a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate login sessions inside a single terminal window or detach and reattach session from a terminal. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program. Particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected.

# Features
A terminal multiplexer can be thought of as a text version of window managers, or as a way of putting attach virtual terminals to any login session.

It is a wrapper that allows multiple text programs to run at the same time, and provides features that allow the user to use the programs within a single interface productivity.

## Persistence

## Multiple windows

## Session Sharing
- Allow multiple computers to connect to the same session at once.
- Enabling collaboration between multiple users.
- The same computer can also be used to make multiple simultaneous connections, providing alternative functionality to screen-splitting, particularly for computers with multiple monitors.
