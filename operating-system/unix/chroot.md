# Overview
A `chroot` on UNIX operating system is an operation that changes the apparent root directory for the current running process and its children.

A program that is run in such a modified environment cannot name (and therefore normally cannot access) files outside the **designated directory tree**. The modified environment is called a **chroot jail**.
