The freedesktop.org [Desktop Entry specification](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_environment) provides a standard for applications to integrate into a desktop environment. Desktop entries are the configuration files that describe how an application is launched and which data it can handle. They also configure how an application appears in a menu with an icon, which is subject to the related [menu specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html) standard.
