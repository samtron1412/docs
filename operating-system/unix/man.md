# Overview
man page (short for manual page) is a form of software documentation usually found on a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system. Topics covered include computer programs (including library and system calls), formal standards and conventions, and even abstract concepts. A user may invoke a man page by issuing the `man <command-name>` or `man <section> <command-name>`.

By default, `man` uses a terminal pager program such as `more` or `less` to display its content.
