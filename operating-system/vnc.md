# Overview
Virtual network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the [Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB)][2] to remotely control another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer to another, relaying the graphical screen updates back in the other direction, over a network.

VNC is platform-independent.
