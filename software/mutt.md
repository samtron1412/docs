Text-base Mail Client. Mutt focuses primarily on being a **Mail User Agent (MUA)**, and was originally written to *view mail*. Later implementations (added for retrieval, sending, and filtering mail) are simplistic compared to other mail applications and, as such, users may wish to use external applications to extend Mutt's capabilities.
