**Wine** is a free and open source **compatibility layer software application** that aims to allow applications designed for Microsoft Windows to run on Unix-like operating systems.

Wine also provides a software library, known as **Winelib**, against which developers can compile Windows applications to help port them to Unix-like systems.
