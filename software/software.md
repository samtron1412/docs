# Overview

# Program life-cycle phase

- Program life cycle phases are the stages a computer program undergoes,
from initial creation to deployment and execution.
- The phases are: edit time, compile time, distribution time,
installation time, link time, load time, and run time.
- Life-cycle phases do not necessarily happen in a linear order, and
they can be intertwined in various ways.

## Edit time (or Design time)

Edit time is when the source code of the program is being edited.
- Bug fix, refactoring, or addition of new features.

## Compile time

Compile time is when source code is translated into machine code by a
compiler.
- Language checking

## Distribution time

- Distribution time is process of transferring a copy of a program to a
user.

## Installation time

Installation time gets the distributed program ready for execution on
the user's computer.

## Link time

Link time connects all of the necessary machine code components of a
program, including externals.
- Static linking: the connection is made by the compiler, which is
always prior to execution.
- Dynamic linking: the OS does this just before, or even during
execution.

## Load time

When the OS takes the program's executable from storage, and places it
into active memory, in order to begin execution.

## Run time

Run time is the execution phase, when the central processing unit
executes the program's machine code instructions.
- Programs may run indefinitely until a normal termination or a crash.
