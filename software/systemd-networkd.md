# Overview

systemd-networkd is a system daemon that manages network
configurations.
- It detects and configures network devices as they
appear.
- It can also create virtual network devices.
- This service can be especially useful to set up complex network
configurations for a container managed by systemd-nspawn or for virtual
machines.
