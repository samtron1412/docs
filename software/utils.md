# procps-ng
**procps** is a set of command line and full-screen utilities that provide information out of the pseudo-filesystem most commonly located at `/proc`. This filesystem provides a simple interface to the kernel data structures. The programs of **procps** generally concentrate on the structures that describe the processes running on the system.
