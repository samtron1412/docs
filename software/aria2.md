# Overview
aria2 is a lightweight multi-protocol and multi-source command-line download utility.

The executable name for the aria2 package is `aria2c`. This legacy naming convention has been retained for backwards compatibility.

# Configuration
aria2 looks to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aria2/aria2.conf` for a set of global configuration options by default.

This behavior can be modified with the `--conf-path` switch.
