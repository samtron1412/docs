# Overview
`composer.json` : only file you have to edit manually. In this file you can lists which packages you want and which versions of that package you want to install.

`composer.lock` : generated by composer install.

# Basic usage
Here's a fairly standard composer work-flow:

1. Add *composer.json* with some dependencies
2. Run `composer install`
3. Add some more dependencies
4. Run `composer update` as you've updated your dependencies

You should never run `composer update` in production.
