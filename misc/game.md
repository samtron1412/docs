# Checklist for a good game

- Reaching goals
    + Goals should not be too easy to achieve. There must be a
      challenge.And when the game progresses the goals should become
      harder to reach and the player has to become better at the game to
      achieve them. This learning curve is very important.
    + In the case of failure, the player always has the feeling he made
      a mistake that he could have avoided. It should not be the game's
      fault that the player lost, but his own.
- Balance
    + Balance between players
    + Balance between the player and the game play
        * The game play is there to help the player, not to fight the
          player.
        * The player should spend his time and energy on the important
          aspects, and the game program should do the rest.
    + Balance between game features
        * Every feature should has its own pros and cons
        * Don't forget that a player must learn to play the game. Make
          sure that there are still new features appearing far into the
          game.
- Rewards
    + You need to reward a player when he achieves a goal.
    + It would be better to gradually increase the maximal player health
      and the damage opponents do, such that the increase in health is
      not significant anymore. The player still gets his reward but it
      has less influence on the game play. Don't take the reward away
      from players.
    + You also need to decide whether rewards are predictable or more
      random.
    + Make sure the player notices the rewards he gets and starts
      understanding why he gets them. Using some sound effect or some
      graphical effect.
- Flow
    + A game gives challenges to the player and the player develops
      abilities to conquer these challenges. While the game progresses
      the abilities of the player improve and, hence, the challenges
      should become more difficult.
    + It is good to let your game from time to time get to top hard and
      then give some easier challenges again. This helps the player to
      improve his abilities. So the difficulty should zigzag through the
      flow.
    + Monitor the players behavior (for example how much damage he
      takes) and adapt the number or quality of the opponents to this.
      Make sure that the player always progresses but let the reward
      depend on his qualities.
- Presence and Immersion: the story, the game world, the main
  characters, the music, the special effects

# How to get a job in game industry

- Close community, so only through close network
- Multiple language -> ability to learn new things
- Create your own apps and show that -> wrong. They care about team work
  because in real job you don't work alone -> meetup, hackathon,
  informal club, contribute to open source project
- Love game -> do what you love
