# Overview
**Politics** is the practice and theory of influencing other people. More narrowly, it refers to achieving and exercising positions of governance â€” organized control over a human community, particularly a state. Furthermore, politics is the study or practice of the distribution of power and resources within a given community (a usually hierarchically organized population) as well as the interrelationship(s) between communities.
