# Fail-safe & Fail-secure
- A fail-safe is a device or practice, that in the event of a specific type of failure, responds in a way that will cause no harm, or at least minimizes harm to other devices or to personnel.
- **Fail-safe** means that a device will not endanger lives or property when it fails. **Fail-secure** means that access or data will not fall into the wrong hands in a failure.
- For example, if a building catches fire, fail-safe systems would unlock doors to ensure quick escape and allow firefighters inside, while fail-secure would lock doors to prevent unauthorized access to the building.
- When a fail-safe system fails, it is safe or at least no less safe than when it was operating correctly.
- An aircraft landing on an aircraft carrier increases the throttle to full power at touchdown. If the arresting wires fail to capture the plane, it is able to take off again.
- Coiling and rolling fire doors that are activated by building alarm systems or local smoke detectors must close automatically when signaled regardless of power. In case of power outage the coiling fire door does not need to close, but must be capable of automatic closing when given a signal from the building alarm systems or smoke detectors. A temperature sensitive fusible link may be employed to hold the fire doors open against gravity or a closing spring. In case of fire, the link melts and releases the doors, and they close.
