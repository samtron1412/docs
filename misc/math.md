# Overview
Mathematics is the language of universe and the natural basic science.

## Definitions of Mathematics
### Normal definitions
- Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change.

### Greater abstraction - Philosophical definitions
- Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions.

## [Mathematical Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics)

## Notation, language, and rigor

# Fields of Mathematics
## Foundations and philosophy
### Mathematical logic
Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics.

### Set theory
Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects.

### Category theory
Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them, is still in development.

### Theory of computation
In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?"

# Limits
## Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT)
- f(x) is continuous on a closed interval [a, b]
- f(a) # f(b)
- then for every value f(a) < M < f(b), there exists at least one value a < c < b such that f(c) = M
