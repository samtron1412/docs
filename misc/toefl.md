      their notes when they answer the questions.
- Each conversation is associated with five questions and each lecture
  with six. (5x2 + 6x4 = 34)
- The questions are meant to measure the ability to understand main
  ideas, important details, implications, relationships between ideas,
  organization of information, speaker purpose and speaker attitude.

## Speaking

- Consisting of six tasks: two independent and four integrated.
- In the two independent tasks, test-takers answer opinion questions on
  familiar topics.
- In two of the integrated tasks, test-takers read a short passage,
  listen to an academic course lecture or a conversation about campus
  life and answer a question by combining appropriate information from
  the text and the talk.

  lecture or a conversation about campus life and then respond to a
  question about what they heard.

## Writing

- Consisting two tasks: one integrated and one independent.
- In the integrated task, test-takers read a passage on an academic
  topic and then listen to a speaker discuss it. The test-taker then
  writes a summary about the important points in the *listening passage*
  and explains how these relate to the key points of the reading
  passage.
- In the independent task, the test-taker must write an essay that
  states their opinion or choice, and then explain it, rather than
  simply listing personal preferences or choices.
