## Information Science

Information science is an interdisciplinary field primarily concerned
with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage,
retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information.

Practitioners study application and usage of knowledge in organizations
along with the interaction between people, organizations and any
existing information systems with the aim of creating, replacing,
improving, or understanding information systems.

## Information Technology

Information technology is the application of computers to store, study,
retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the
context of a business or other enterprise.

## Computer

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary
set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.

## Computer Science

- Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and
  engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
- Computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes
  that scale.
- It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its
  applications.
- It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression,
  and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that
  underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage,
  communication of, and access to information.

## Computer Engineering

Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of
electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer
hardware and software.
- A little focus on hardware


# Hardware

## Computer Hardware Engineering

- Most computer hardware engineers research, develop, design, and test
  various computer equipment.
- This can range from circuit boards and microprocessors to routers.

## Computer Hardware

Computer hardware is the collection of physical components that
constitute a computer system.
- Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer,
such as monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound
card, motherboard, etc.

## Processor

In computing, a processor or processing unit is an electronic circuit
which performs operations on some external data source, usually memory
or some other data stream.
- The term is frequently used to refer to the central processing unit
  (CPU) in a system, but typical computer systems or a system on chip
  (SoC - microcontroller) combine many specialized processors.
- Examples: CPU - Central processing unit, GPU - Graphics processing
  unit, Sound chip, PPU - Physics processing unit, etc.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuit that carries
out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic
arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified
by the instructions.
- Control unit (CU)
- Processing unit: ALU and registers
- Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, meaning they are contained on a
  single integrated circuit (IC) chip.
- A multi-core processor is a single chip containing two or more CPUs
  called "cores."
- An IC that contains one or more CPUs, memory, and peripheral
  interfaces are called microcontroller or systems on a chip (SoC)

## Microcontroller - System on Chip (SoC)

- A microcontroller (or MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small
  computer on a single integrated circuit built for the purpose of
  dealing with specific tasks, such as displaying information in a
  microwave LED or receiving information from a television's remote
  control.
- In modern terminology, it is a system on chip or SoC.
- A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs along with memory and
  programmable input/output peripherals.


# Software

## Computer Software Engineering

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the
development of software in a systematic method.
- Computer software engineers develop, design, and test software.
- They construct, and maintain computer programs, as well as set up
  networks.

## Computer Software

Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system
that consists of data and/or computer instructions, in contract to the
physical hardware from which the system is built.

## RTFM

- Read The Fucking Manual
- Read The Fine Manual
- Read The Friendly Manual

## Shutdown

stop services, kill apps, unmount

## Halt

shutdown + halt (stop all CPU, power-on states)

## Poweroff

shutdown + power off

## General-purpose Programming Language

In computer software a general-purpose programming language is a
programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide
variety of application domains.

## Domain-specific Language

A domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within
a specific application domain.

## Page Description Language

A page description language (PDL) is a language that describes the
appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output
bitmap. An overlapping term is printer control language, which includes
Hewlett-Packard's PCL. PostScript is one of the most noted page
description languages. PDF, SVG...

## Markup Language

A (document) markup language is a modern system for annotating a
document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.
HTML, XML, TeX, ...

## Toy Language

A toy language is a term for a computer programming language that is not
considered to fulfill the *robustness* or *completeness* requirement of
a computer programming language. As such it is not considered a suitable
language for creating *solid* and *reliable* programs for use in
production environments.

## Esolang

An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a
programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer
programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, or
as a joke.

## Dynamic Programming Language

`Dynamic programming language` is a term used in computer science to
describe a class of *high-level programming languages* which, at
*runtime*, execute many common programming behaviors that static
programming languages perform during compilation. Dynamic languages are
frequently (but not always) referred to as “scripting languages”. List
of popular dynamic programming language: Javascript, Objective-C, Perl,
PHP, Powershell, Python, Ruby.

## Hooking

Kind of event handler, use call back function or some code to handles
events. When something happens, hook will trigger some code that allows
you to tap in to a module provide different behavior.

## Callback

A callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument
to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at
some convenient time.

Programming languages support callbacks in different ways, often
implementing them with subroutines, lambda expressions, blocks, or
function pointers.

## Failover

Failover means when a system fail it will switching to a redundant or
standby system.

## Failback

Failback is a process of restoring the application in a state of
failover back to its original state (before failure).

## Scrobble - a.k.a. scrobbling

- To find other people who share similar interests.
- To scrobble a song means that when you listen to it, the name of the
  song is sent to a Web site (e.g. Last.fm, Libre.fm) and added to your
  music profile.
- Last.fm or Libre.fm like a social music network, once you start
  scrobbling yourself, you can see what artists you really listen to the
  most, view your listening habits on your profile page, and allow
  others to see your tastes in music. These companies use this data to
  organize and recommend music to people, to create personalized radio
  stations, and to see what other users listened to the most.
