shutdown + halt (stop all CPU, power-on states)

# poweroff
shutdown + power off

# General-purpose programming language
In computer software a general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains.

# Domain-specific language
A domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within a specific application domain.

# Page description language
A page description language (PDL) is a language that describes the appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output bitmap. An overlapping term is printer control language, which includes Hewlett-Packard's PCL. PostScript is one of the most noted page description languages. PDF, SVG...

# Markup language
A (document) markup language is a modern system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text. HTML, XML, TeX, ...

# Toy language
A toy language is a term for a computer programming language that is not considered to fulfill the *robustness* or *completeness* requirement of a computer programming language. As such it is not considered a suitable language for creating *solid* and *reliable* programs for use in production environments.

# Esolang
An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, or as a joke.

# Dynamic programming language
`Dynamic programming language` is a term used in computer science to describe a class of *high-level programming languages* which, at *runtime*, execute many common programming behaviors that static programming languages perform during compilation. Dynamic languages are frequently (but not always) referred to as “scripting languages”. List of popular dynamic programming language: Javascript, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Powershell, Python, Ruby.

# Hooking
Kind of event handler, use call back function or some code to handles events. When something happens, hook will trigger some code that allows you to tap in to a module provide different behavior.

# Callback
A callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at some convenient time.

Programming languages support callbacks in different ways, often implementing them with subroutines, lambda expressions, blocks, or function pointers.

# Failover
Failover means when a system fail it will switching to a redundant or standby system.

# Failback
Failback is a process of restoring the application in a state of failover back to its original state (before failure).

# Service Layer
A Service provides a away of a client to interact with some functionality in the application. Some business meaning. For example, `buyTicket`, `sellTicket` and so on. Has some context within the application

# Helper class
More generic and don't care what app they are helping like an utility to all application can use it. For example, convert date ...

# Extend
Is used when a thing adds steps to another first thing.

# Include
Is used to extract thing fragments that are **duplicated** in multiple thing.

# Web Application
Web applications differ from conventional websites in that web applications can create a dynamic response. many websites deliver only static pages. A web application can interact with databases and business logic engines to customize a response.

# Model - View - Controller (MVC)
In practice, we find that unless these concerns are separated, larger applications become difficult to maintain.

One way to separate concerns in a software application is to use a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- The Model represents the business or database code
- The View represents the page design code
- The Controller represents the navigational code
