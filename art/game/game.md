# Overview

## Definitions

### Chris Crawford

1. Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and
   entertainment if made for money.
2. A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive. Movies
   and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.
3. If no goals are associated with a plaything, it is a toy. (Crawford
   notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if
   the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not
   games.) If it has goals, a plaything is a challenge.
4. If a challenge has no "active agent against whom you compete," it is
   a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict. (Crawford admits that
   this is a subjective test. Video games with noticeably algorithmic
   artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the
   patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.)
5. Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not
   attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a
   competition. (Competitions include racing and figure skating.)
   However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a
   game.

(e.g., miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, tokens, or a
computer).

## Skill, strategy, and chance

- Games of skill
  + physical skills: wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting,
  etc.
  + mental skills: chess, checkers, etc.
- Games of strategy: chess, checkers, go, tic-tac-toe, monopoly, etc.
- Games of chance: blackjack, monopoly, rock-paper-scissors, etc.

### Computer games

# Computer Game

- What is a computer Game?
    + A software program
    + in which one or more players make decisions
    + through the control of game objects and resources
    + in pursuit of a goal

## Game Design

- Game Design = Cool idea for characters and story + **game mechanics**
- Game mechanics: the basic rules and interactions that make a game fun
  to play.
- Think of game mechanics as a car engine and the graphics, characters,
  and storyline as the bodywork and finishing.

### Checklist for a good computer game

- Reaching goals
    + Goals should not be too easy to achieve. There must be a
      challenge.And when the game progresses the goals should become
      harder to reach and the player has to become better at the game to
      achieve them. This learning curve is very important.
    + In the case of failure, the player always has the feeling he made
      a mistake that he could have avoided. It should not be the game's
      fault that the player lost, but his own.
- Balance
    + Balance between players
    + Balance between the player and the game play
        * The game play is there to help the player, not to fight the
          player.
        * The player should spend his time and energy on the important
          aspects, and the game program should do the rest.
    + Balance between game features
        * Every feature should has its own pros and cons
        * Don't forget that a player must learn to play the game. Make
          sure that there are still new features appearing far into the
          game.
- Rewards
    + You need to reward a player when he achieves a goal.
    + It would be better to gradually increase the maximal player health
      and the damage opponents do, such that the increase in health is
      not significant anymore. The player still gets his reward but it
      has less influence on the game play. Don't take the reward away
      from players.
    + You also need to decide whether rewards are predictable or more
      random.
    + Make sure the player notices the rewards he gets and starts
      understanding why he gets them. Using some sound effect or some
      graphical effect.
- Flow
    + A game gives challenges to the player and the player develops
      abilities to conquer these challenges. While the game progresses
      the abilities of the player improve and, hence, the challenges
      should become more difficult.
    + It is good to let your game from time to time get to top hard and
      then give some easier challenges again. This helps the player to
      improve his abilities. So the difficulty should zigzag through the
      flow.
    + Monitor the players behavior (for example how much damage he
      takes) and adapt the number or quality of the opponents to this.
      Make sure that the player always progresses but let the reward
      depend on his qualities.
- Presence and Immersion: the story, the game world, the main
  characters, the music, the special effects

### Interactive Challenges

- Interactive: players have some control over the outcome of games, but
  film audiences do not.
- Challenges: players must overcome to win the game.

#### Game Genres

+ Arcade games: where reaction speed is the most important aspect of the
  game.
+ Puzzle games: where clever thinking is the most important aspect.
  chess games, etc.
+ Role playing games (RPG): where you steer a character through a
  dangerous world. Diablo, etc.
+ Strategy games: either real-time (RTS) or turn-based. Age of Empires,
  etc.
+ Management games: in which you must build up an empire. SimCity, etc.
+ Adventure games: where the story line is rather crucial.
+ First-person shooters. Doom, Quake, etc.
+ Third-person shooters: where the player directly controls a game
  character through a hostile world. Tomb Raider, etc.
+ Sport games
+ Racing games
+ Simulators

### Challenges

#### Difficulty

- Choosing the difficult level.

#### Goals

- Make goals clear to players.
- Make the game easy at first, but harder and harder.
- Show players' progress.

#### Rewards

- Give players specific rewards and randomly rewards.

#### Subgoals

- Short term goals.

### Interactivity

#### Choices and control

#### Control Overload

#### Unfair Punishment

#### Audio Feedback

### Levels and Features

#### Selecting Features

Before you begin thinking of feature ideas, give some serious thought to
the kind of progression you want to see running through your game. Is it
about developing the equipment and abilities of a single character or
building up a specialist team? Will levels force the player to apply
their skills in different kinds of environments, or just pit them
against increasingly challenging obstacles? Once you have made some of
these kinds of decisions, then you are ready to sit down with some
friends and start brainstorming ideas.

- New features for the player(s) to use:
  + Abilities (e.g., attack moves, swimming, flying)
  + Equipment (e.g., weapons, armor, vehicles)
  + Character (e.g., engineer, wizard, medic)
  + Buildings (e.g., garage, barracks, armory)
- New level features for the player(s) to overcome:
  + Opponents (e.g., with new abilities, buildings, or equipment)
  + Obstacles (e.g., traps, puzzles, terrain)
  + Environment (e.g., battlefields, racing tracks, climate)

#### Designing Levels

"The Game Maker's Apprentice" is a reference to the game player, which
makes the Game Maker the crazy professor! Being a good game designer has
a lot in common with being a good teacher - and just realizing this can
improve your approach to game design.

Inexperienced designers often see players as their opponents, and try to
trick or outwit them by creating impossible challenges. A successful
game designer needs to treat players like their apprentices, balancing
the game's theatrical threat of failure with a true desire to train the
player to master the game.

- Learning Curves:
  + Stage One: big risk of frustration. Designers should use a training
  mode to guide players during this period.
  + Stage Two: (fun) make it last as long as possible.
  + Stage Three: (boring) switch to different difficulty levels
- Difficulty Curves: introducing new features to maintain the stage two
of learning curves.

## Game Engines

A game engine is a software framework designed for the creation and
development of video games. Developers use them to create games for
consoles, mobile devices and personal computers.

The core functionality typically provided by a game engine includes:
- a rendering engine (renderer) for 2D or 3D graphics,
- a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response),
- audio engine,
- scripting,
- animation,
- artificial intelligence,
- networking,
- streaming,
- memory management,
- threading,
- localization support,
- scene graph,
- and may include video support for cinematics.

### Components

#### Main game program

The actual game logic has to be implemented by some algorithms. It is
distinct from any rendering, sound or input work.

#### Rendering engine

It is built upon one or multiple rendering application programming
interfaces (APIs), such as Direct3D or OpenGL which provide a software
abstraction of the graphics processing unit (GPU).

#### Audio engine

It can calculate things on the CPU, or on a dedicated ASIC. Abstraction
APIs, such as OpenAL, SDL audio, XAudio 2, Web Audio, etc. are
available.

#### Physics engine

The physics engine is responsible for emulating the laws of physics
realistically within the application.

## How to get a job in game industry

- Close community, so only through close network
- Multiple language -> ability to learn new things
- Create your own apps and show that -> wrong. They care about team work
  because in real job you don't work alone -> meetup, hackathon,
  informal club, contribute to open source project
- Love game -> do what you love
