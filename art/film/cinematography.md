## TV ratings
### Content label
TV parental guidelines may have one or more letters added to the basic rating to let parents know when a show may contain violence, sex, adult language or suggestive dialogue.

- D - suggestive dialogue (usually means talks about sex)
- L - coarse or crude language
- S - sexual situations
- V - violence
- FV - fantasy violence (children's programming only)

### Audience
#### TV Y: all children (2-6)
This program is designed to be appropriate for all children. Whether animated or live-action, the themes and elements in this program are specifically designed for a very young audience, including children from ages `2-6`. This program is not expected to frighten younger children.

#### TV Y7: directed to older children (7+)
This program is designed for children age 7 and above. It may be more appropriate for children who have acquired the developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and reality. Themes and elements in this program may include mild fantasy violence or comedic violence, or may frighten children under the age of 7. Therefore, parents may wish to consider the suitability of this program for their very young children.

#### TV G: general audience
Most parents would find this program suitable for all ages. Although this rating does not signify a program designed specifically for children, most parents may let younger children watch this program unattended. It contains little or no violence, no strong language and little or no sexual dialogue or situations.

#### TV PG: parental guidance suggested
This program contains material that parents may find unsuitable for younger children. Many parents may want to watch it with their younger children. The theme itself may call for parental guidance and/or the program may contain one or more of the following: some **suggestive dialogue (D)**, infrequent **coarse language (L)**, some **sexual situations (S)**, or **moderate violence (V)**.

#### TV 14: parents strongly cautioned
This program contains some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age. Parents are strongly urged to exercise greater care in monitoring this program and are cautioned against letting children under the age of 14 watch unattended. This program may contain one or more of the following: intensely **suggestive dialogue (D)**, strong **coarse language (L)**, intense **sexual situations (S)**, or intense **violence (V)**.

#### TV MA: mature audience only
This program is specifically designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17. This program may contain one or more of the following: **crude indecent language (L)**, **explicit sexual activity (S)**, or **graphic violence (V)**.


## Movie ratings
### G : general audiences
G ratings are most notable for what the films don't include - sex and nudity, substance abuse, or realistic/non-cartoon violence.

### PG : parental guidance
There may be mild strong language, and some violence, but there will not be substance use or abuse.

### PG-13 : parental guidance - 13+
with parents strongly cautioned, as some material may not be suitable for children under 13. Again, it's a matter of what isn't in the film; any nudity has to be non-sexual, any swear words have to be used sparingly, and, in the event of the specific obscenity we politely call the F-word, not used in a sexual context.  (You can say "Oh, (BLANK) this!" in a PG-13 film, but not more than once, and never “I’d love to (BLANK) Denise...") Violence in PG-13 films may be intense, but must also be bloodless - see Jurassic World or any Marvel Movie, for example - and it is, as per usual, the Ratings Board's call if the film is deemed to be more than PG but less than R.

### R : restricted
with no one under 17 admitted without an accompanying parent or guardian. This rating is given for strong and frequent language and violence, nudity for sexual purposes and the abuse of drugs.

### NC-17
**No one under 18 admitted**. This rare rating is awarded to films which feature mature elements in such profusion – or in such intensity – that it surpasses even the R.
