# It's My Life

This ain't a song for broken hearted. (This song is not for sad people, depress people, weak people)

No silent prayer for the faith departed. (No silent prayer for people had lost their faith, their confident, their belief)

I ain't gonna be just the face in the crowd. (I am not going to be just like everyone else in the crowd)

You gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud. (He not going to be quiet, he going to be shout loudly, everyone can hear him)

Chorus:

It's my life. (It's not your life, It's not other people life. I living my own life by my own way.)

It now or never. (I'm going to be act now, I'm going to be decisive (quyet doan). You must act now, you can't wait, you can't be scare)

I ain't gonna live forever. (I'm not going to live forever. I am going to die some day, that mean I had to live right now, I can't wait, don't wait to live your life, live now, live fully right now)

I just wanna live while I'm alive. (I want to live fully right now while I'm still alive)

My heart like an open highway. (An open highway very romantic image, very American, a symbol for freedom. Going where you want to go, doing what you want to do)

Like Frankie said, "I did it my way". (Frankie a famous singer, in famous song 'My way'. Living your own life. Doing what you feel, to be yourself)

This is for the one who stood their ground. (stood their ground: mean to refuse to quit, you will not quit, you will not surrender, you will not go to backward)

For Tommy and Gyna, who never back down. (back down: mean to quit, you run away)

Tomorrow is getting harder, make no mistake. (in the future, life going to be challenge, tomorrow will harder)

Luck ain't even lucky, you got to make your own breaks. (being lucky is actually not lucky; sometimes when you lucky, you think lucky easy for you is good, sometimes it not actually good because you learn to be lazy, you learn to alway look for something to be lucky. Sometime better have fight and struggle because it teach you ... break: mean opportunity, you make your own opportunity, your own luck)

Better stand tall, when they calling you out. (stand tall: mean you must to be confident, to be strong, not afraid. They: mean anybody want to fight you, cause the problems for you. calling you out: challenging you, idea from cowboy movie)

Don't bend, don't break, don't back down. (don't bend: mean don't get weak, don't get sort; don't break: mean don't be defeated, don't quit; don't back down: don't go backward, be strong; keep fighting)

Having you own value and living a life special to you and being true to yourself and finding your own belief, your own goal, you own meaning in life and living that. The most people of course follow other people tell them, what teacher tell them, what parent tell them, what the government tell them, what the TV tell them. Put people to afraid to live their own life.
