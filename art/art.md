# Overview

## What?

To me, art is
- a product of my skills and imagination (thinking abilities)
- it makes me feel excited, passionate, and rewarded
- it connects me with my "ideal" world

To be human, we have an ability to create. The urge to make and enjoy
what we call art.
- Not "understood", let's "feel" or "experience"

Art: gesture, dance, draw, speak, sing, write, build
- music
- dance
- theater
- literature
- the visual arts
    + drawing
    + painting
    + sculpture
    + film
    + architecture
    + design

A work of art is the visual expression of an idea or experience, formed
with skill, through the use of a medium.

## Why?

- One of my different ways to calm myself and to release stress
    + Maybe it doesn't need too much energy to feel art
    + My body releases chemicals to calm my mind
- Helping me aware of my existing in present
    + from the common to the forbidden, the mundane to the sacred, the
      repugnant to the sublime.
    + being alive
- To appreciate the things beyond the first impression and to learn how
  to notice the things behind the scene.
    + To open mind
    + To enrich my experience of life

## How?

The source of all art, science, and technology is human imagination, or
creative thinking.
- An ability to think in a new way

Five traits that seem to define creativity
1. Associating (analogy): the ability to make connections across
   seemingly unrelated fields.
2. Questioning: persistently challenging the status quo, asking why
   things function as they do now, and how or why they might be changed.
3. Observing: intently watching the world around, without judgment, in
   search of new insights or ways of operating.
4. Networking: being willing to interact with other, and learn from
   them, even if their views are radically different or their
   competencies seem unrelated.
5. Experimenting: exploring new possibilities by trying them out,
   building models, and taking them apart for further improvement.
