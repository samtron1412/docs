X Window System (X11, or shortened to simply X, and sometimes informally X-Windows) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on UNIX-like computer operating systems.

X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and keyboard. X does not control the user interface - this is handled by individual programs.

X originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1984. The protocol has been version 11 since September 1987.
