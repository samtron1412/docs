### Freon
Freon is a trade name for a class of chemicals (known as Chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's) used as a refrigerant in air conditioning systems.

Commercially available Freons include:

- **R134A** - Tetrafluoroethane (for autos)
- **R22** Chlorodiofluoromethane (for air conditioning)
- **R410A** - Is and alternate/replacement for R22 due to R22's world wide phaseout since it is shown to deplete the Ozone Layer
