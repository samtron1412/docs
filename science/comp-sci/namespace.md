# Overview

In computing, a namespace is a set of symbols (id) that are used to
organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred
to by name (id). Prominent examples include:
- file systems are namespaces that assign names to files;
- some programming languages organize their variables and subroutines in
  namespaces.
- computer networks and distributed systems assign names to resources,
  such as computers, printers, websites, remote files, etc.

Namespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of
names in different contexts.
