# Overview

## US Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) (post-1981)

- 17 characters long: (from left to right)
    + The first three characters: world manufacturer identifier (WMI)
        + https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Vehicle_Identification_Numbers_(VIN_codes)/World_Manufacturer_Identifier_(WMI)
        + 1st character: where the vehicle was built
            * U.S. start with 1, 4 or 5. Canada is 2, and Mexico is 3. Japan
              is J, South Korea is K, England is S, Germany is W, and Sweden
              or Finland is Y.
    + 4th to 8th: vehicle description (model, body type, restraint
      system, transmission type, and engine code)
    + 9th: check digit to verify a valid VIN
    + In the 10th position, you'll see a letter indicating the model
      year. The letters from B to Y correspond to the model years 1981
      to 2000. The VIN does not use I, O, Q, U or Z. From 2001 to 2009,
      the numbers 1 through 9 were used in place of letters. The
      alphabet started over from A in 2010 and will continue until 2030.
    + The letter or number in position 11 indicates the manufacturing
      plant where the vehicle was assembled. Each automaker has its own
      set of plant codes.
    + The last six digits (positions 12 through 17) are the production
      sequence numbers, which each car receives on the assembly line.

## Car Attributes

### Trim

Trim is short for "trim package" and is also known as "submodel" or
"trim level". A vehicle's trim denotes different configurations of
standard equipment and amenities.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord has a variety of trims: SE, LX, EX,
DX.

A vehicle's trim is typically part of the branding on the outside of the
vehicle. "Base" refers to the base trim model of a vehicle.

### Engine

A vehicle's engine is described by a number of attributes. This
typically includes volume displacement (in liters), block type, and
number of cylinders.

For example, the 2006 Ford F-150 XLT was made with one of three engines:
A) 4.2L V6, B) 4.6L V8, and C) 5.4L V8. Engine (A) has a volume
displacement of 4.2 liters, a "V" block type, and 6 cylinders.

In some cases it is necessary to know more specific details about your
engine to determine the compatibility of a part. For newer vehicles,
information about the engine can typically be found on the plastic
molding on top of the engine.

### Body Style

Body Style is described by a Body Type — such as sedan, coupe, or wagon
— and the number of doors on the vehicle.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord is available in the following two
Body Styles: 2 Door Coupe and 4 Door Sedan.

### Mfr Body Code

A Manufacturer Body Code, sometimes referred to as a chassis code, is a
part number for the frame of the vehicle. The chassis of one vehicle may
be used in other vehicles and over different year ranges.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord has six manufacturer body codes
associated with it: CF8, CG1, CG2, CG3, CG5, and CG6.

This code is generally marked or stamped on the vehicle. The location of
the marking varies by manufacturer.

### Transmission

The transmission of a vehicle is a combination of the number of speeds,
control type (automatic, standard/manual, CVT, dual clutch),
transmission type (transmission or transaxle), and manufacturer.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord has the following transmission
options:

4-speed automatic transaxle
5-speed standard transaxle

#### Transmission Type:

A transaxle transmission type transfers power directly to the front
wheels of the vehicle. The other transmission type transfers power
directly to the rear wheels of the vehicle and is typically referred to
as a "transmission". All-wheel drive vehicles have transaxle
transmission types.

#### Control Type:

There are four control types: automatic, standard (also known as
"manual"), automatic CVT, and automatic dual clutch. Automatic and
manual control types are the most common control types found in vehicles
on the road today. Automatic CVT control types are typically found in
hybrid vehicles.

### Drive Type

This option indicates to which wheels power is transferred from the
engine. Possible values include:

- FWD Front wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to
  the front wheels.
- RWD Rear wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to
  the rear wheels.
- 4WD Four-wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to
  the rear wheels but can be "turned on" to the front wheels as well.
- AWD All-wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to all
  wheels at all times.

### Brakes

This option describes the brake configuration on the vehicle. This
includes the front and rear brake types (disc or drum), the braking
system (power or manual), and the anti-lock braking system [ABS] (non-
ABS, 2-wheel ABS, or 4-wheel ABS).

### Steering

This option describes the steering system in the vehicle. This includes
the steering system (manual or power) and the steering type (gear or
rack).

### Bed

Bed describes the type and length of the pickup cargo bed (in inches) on
a truck.

For example, the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Crew Cab has a
Fleetside bed type and comes in varying lengths: 69.3", 78.7", and
97.6".

### Spring Types

This option refers to the type of suspension in the front and rear of
the vehicle.

For example, the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Crew Cab has coil
springs in the front and leaf springs in the rear. Possible spring types
include coil, leaf, torsion bar, air, rubber, torsion, and hydraulic.

### Wheelbase

Wheelbase refers to the distance (in inches) between the front and rear
axles of a vehicle.

For example, the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Crew Cab is available
in a number of different wheelbase configurations: 119", 133", 143.5",
and 157.5".

# Buying Cars

## Car Title

- Certificate of origin
    + This is the first title document issued by the vehicle
      manufacturer to the franchised dealer where the vehicle was
      delivered to. This document is used to transfer the vehicle to the
      first owner, and obtain title.
- Manufacturer’s statement of origin
    + This is similar to a certificate of origin used by some vehicle
      manufacturers import or domestic.
- Clear title
    + When a title is issued to an owner with no lien specified the
      title is clear.
- Salvage title
    + When a vehicle incurs some type of loss event such as major
      damage, theft, or repair, the title may be designated as a salvage
      title.
        * The decision to place a title in salvage status is normally
          made by the insurance company who pays a claim on the vehicle.
        * In some states there are statutory regulations which require
          an insurer to brand a vehicle with a salvage title.
        * An example may be that a vehicle incurred damage more than 60%
          of its value.
        * However, an insurance company can decide to place a salvage
          title brand on any vehicle it decides to, even if there is
          little or no damage.
        * A salvage title, junk title, rebuilt title, or certificate of
          destruction are almost always permanent brands on the title
          which cannot be removed.
        * In rare cases a very complex and expensive process of
          reconstructing the vehicle and inspection may upgrade a
          branded title status, but it typically involves more expense
          than the vehicle is worth.
    + Salvage titles can normally be registered for road use. In some
      states an inspection is required to make sure that the vehicle is
      safe for the road, and that any parts used for repair are legal
      and have a verified origin. For your own safety make sure that any
      vehicle you purchase which as a salvage title has operational
      airbags and valid documentation of the VIN# and all major
      component parts.
    + Any attempt to remove, obscure, conceal, or alter a title brand
      using unauthorized means can be a violation of law often referred
      to as “title washing” or “title laundering.” The salvage title
      designation is shared with all 50 states. Evading a title brand is
      a serious offense. Getting a new title for that purpose is illegal
      and results is serious criminal penalties.
- Junk title
    + A title which has been sold to a junkyard may incur a junk title
      designation if the vehicle is intended to be scrapped or parted
      out. A salvage title, junk title, rebuilt title, or certificate of
      destruction are almost always permanent brands on the title which
      cannot be removed. In rare cases a very complex and expensive
      process of reconstructing the vehicle and inspection may upgrade a
      branded title status, but it typically involves more expense than
      the vehicle is worth.
- Bonded title
    + Obtaining a vehicle title when there is serious deficiency in the
      ownership documentation can sometimes be done using a bonded
      title. In this process a security bond is purchased equalling the
      amount of the value of the vehicle. This bond covers any future
      claims in the event that a valid claim to the vehicle comes
      forward in the future. The bond is used to pay to remove the claim
      of ownership or lien. The bonded title will have “Bonded” stamp in
      it for a period of 3 to 5 years. In many cases the bonded title is
      more expensive than other title recovery options, but may be a
      last resort when other methods are not possible. Contact us to
      determine if a bonded title or other option is most beneficial.
- Reconstructed title
    + A vehicle which has been substantially rebuilt may have a
      reconstructed title brand issued by an insurance company, body
      shop, collision center, or licensed rebuilder. A vehicle with a
      reconstructed title can normally be registered for road use, but
      may have an inspection requirement to verify it is road worthy.
- Affidavit title
    + A title may be issued under an affidavit in lieu of other missing
      documentation.
- Rebuilt title
    + A vehicle which has been substantially rebuilt may have a rebuilt
      title brand issued by an insurance company, body shop, collision
      center, or licensed rebuilder. A vehicle with a rebuilt title can
      normally be registered for road use, but may have an inspection
      requirement to verify it is road worthy.The vehicle insurance may
      have limits if the title is rebuilt.
- Certificate of destruction
    + When an insurance company has paid a claim for a vehicle and taken
      ownership from the insured, they have the option of processing the
      title as a certificate of destruction. In this case the vehicle is
      intended to be destroyed and never to be used on the road or
      registered. It is unlikely that a vehicle with a certificate of
      destruction can ever be issued a valid title for transfer.
    + A vehicle with a certificate of destruction can sometimes appear
      to be in acceptable condition. The insurance company decides to
      prevent the car from road use to limit their liability in the
      event that the car is driven and is involved in an accident at a
      later date. If it is proven that an injury in an accident is
      because the car had some existing defect, the injured person could
      claim that the insurance company should not have let the car go
      back on the road.
    + A vehicle in otherwise good condition can be issued a certificate
      of destruction if the insurance company thinks that the airbags
      could be damages, the frame could be weakened, or simply does not
      want to spend the money to do a detailed inspection, and just
      wants to sell it cheap to a junkyard.
- Parts only title
    + A parts only designation is typically found on a bill of sale or
      transfer form, not on a title. However, if a parts only bill of
      sale is submitted for vehicle title processing, the title may be
      issued with a salvage brand or other cloud on title.
- Electronic title
    + Many state DMV title systems are issuing electronic or paperless
      titles. If you need an actual title document those can often be
      obtained for transfer or loan processing.
- Lienholder title
    + A vehicle with a lien or title loan may have a title issued
      directly to the lienholder. The purchaser will be listed as the
      owner, but the title will list the lender as lien holder, and the
      lender will retain possession of the title.
- Export title
    + A vehicle being exported will likely need title documentation for
      customs clearance. If the vehicle is not declared at the exit
      point, clear title may not be possible in the destination
      country. Start the title process early so that port storage fees
      do not accumulate while waiting for title.
- Import title
    + A vehicle being imported to the US must have legal title to clear
      customs. If the vehicle was previously titled in the US this is a
      vehicle title recovery process only. If the vehicle was not
      originally manufactured for the US market, there are requirements
      for certifying that the vehicle is legal for use in the United
      States. The Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental
      Protection Agency (EPA), National Highway Transportation Safety
      Administration (NHTSA) and other agencies will need to verify that
      the vehicle is meets standards for emissions, safety, bumper
      height, and other guidelines prior to entering the country.
