# Overview

## Car Attributes

### Trim

Trim is short for "trim package" and is also known as "submodel" or
"trim level". A vehicle's trim denotes different configurations of
standard equipment and amenities.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord has a variety of trims: SE, LX, EX,
DX.

A vehicle's trim is typically part of the branding on the outside of the
vehicle. "Base" refers to the base trim model of a vehicle.

### Engine

A vehicle's engine is described by a number of attributes. This
typically includes volume displacement (in liters), block type, and
number of cylinders.

For example, the 2006 Ford F-150 XLT was made with one of three engines:
A) 4.2L V6, B) 4.6L V8, and C) 5.4L V8. Engine (A) has a volume
displacement of 4.2 liters, a "V" block type, and 6 cylinders.

In some cases it is necessary to know more specific details about your
engine to determine the compatibility of a part. For newer vehicles,
information about the engine can typically be found on the plastic
molding on top of the engine.

### Body Style

Body Style is described by a Body Type — such as sedan, coupe, or wagon
— and the number of doors on the vehicle.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord is available in the following two
Body Styles: 2 Door Coupe and 4 Door Sedan.

### Mfr Body Code

A Manufacturer Body Code, sometimes referred to as a chassis code, is a
part number for the frame of the vehicle. The chassis of one vehicle may
be used in other vehicles and over different year ranges.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord has six manufacturer body codes
associated with it: CF8, CG1, CG2, CG3, CG5, and CG6.

This code is generally marked or stamped on the vehicle. The location of
the marking varies by manufacturer.

### Transmission

The transmission of a vehicle is a combination of the number of speeds,
control type (automatic, standard/manual, CVT, dual clutch),
transmission type (transmission or transaxle), and manufacturer.

For example, the 2002 Honda Accord has the following transmission
options:

4-speed automatic transaxle
5-speed standard transaxle

#### Transmission Type:

A transaxle transmission type transfers power directly to the front
wheels of the vehicle. The other transmission type transfers power
directly to the rear wheels of the vehicle and is typically referred to
as a "transmission". All-wheel drive vehicles have transaxle
transmission types.

#### Control Type:

There are four control types: automatic, standard (also known as
"manual"), automatic CVT, and automatic dual clutch. Automatic and
manual control types are the most common control types found in vehicles
on the road today. Automatic CVT control types are typically found in
hybrid vehicles.

### Drive Type

This option indicates to which wheels power is transferred from the
engine. Possible values include:

- FWD Front wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to
  the front wheels.
- RWD Rear wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to
  the rear wheels.
- 4WD Four-wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to
  the rear wheels but can be "turned on" to the front wheels as well.
- AWD All-wheel drive. With this drive type, power is transferred to all
  wheels at all times.

### Brakes

This option describes the brake configuration on the vehicle. This
includes the front and rear brake types (disc or drum), the braking
system (power or manual), and the anti-lock braking system [ABS] (non-
ABS, 2-wheel ABS, or 4-wheel ABS).

### Steering

This option describes the steering system in the vehicle. This includes
the steering system (manual or power) and the steering type (gear or
rack).

### Bed

Bed describes the type and length of the pickup cargo bed (in inches) on
a truck.

For example, the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Crew Cab has a
Fleetside bed type and comes in varying lengths: 69.3", 78.7", and
97.6".

### Spring Types

This option refers to the type of suspension in the front and rear of
the vehicle.

For example, the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Crew Cab has coil
springs in the front and leaf springs in the rear. Possible spring types
include coil, leaf, torsion bar, air, rubber, torsion, and hydraulic.

### Wheelbase

Wheelbase refers to the distance (in inches) between the front and rear
axles of a vehicle.

For example, the 2007 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 LT Crew Cab is available
in a number of different wheelbase configurations: 119", 133", 143.5",
and 157.5".

### Freon
Freon is a trade name for a class of chemicals (known as Chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's) used as a refrigerant in air conditioning systems.

Commercially available Freons include:

- **R134A** - Tetrafluoroethane (for autos)
- **R22** Chlorodiofluoromethane (for air conditioning)
- **R410A** - Is and alternate/replacement for R22 due to R22's world wide phaseout since it is shown to deplete the Ozone Layer

# Tips and Tricks
## How to recharge freon for A/C system
- Start engine + Turn on A/C system (make sure clutch engage) + Put A/C system at coldest setting + Put fan at strongest setting
- Connect hose with freon can (not open can yet)
- Connect another hose with low pressure port. Check the pressure of A/C system.
- Open freon can by spin the valve.
- Shake freon can slowly and check the gauge for the desire pressure.

## How to jump start a car by another car
How to jump start a car:
