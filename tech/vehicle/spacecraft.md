Might be easy on paper, but it's hard in practice.

And it's actually not 300 days. For most planned NASA missions, a one-
way trip would take somewhere around 200 days, sometimes a bit more, and
sometimes a bit less; depending on the orbits of Earth and Mars at the
time. SpaceX's BFR will be able to do it between 80 and 125 days.

The reason why it takes so long to get to other planets is both fuel and
safety.
- For safety, if you're on a trajectory that takes you there in 200 days
  (Called a Hohmann transfer), sure, that's a long time, but if
  something happens, it loops back to Earth without the need for fuel,
  it's also the most energy efficient, meaning you need the least amount
  of fuel.
- For fuel reasons, chemical rockets aren't very efficient, and you need
  a lot of fuel to get them up to speed and back down again.

Ion rockets are better, as they take less fuel, but it takes awhile to
get them up to speed as well.

Nuclear thermal can probably do about the same time to Mars as SpaceX,
but anti-nuclear types have hindred its development.

Plasma rockets are promising, and they can get us there in ~40 days; but
it's still in early stages, and we would need enormous solar arrays, or
a nuclear reactor (Which, again, anti-nuclear types hindred) to power
the engine.

Then there's fusion, which could do it in 30 days, maybe less. There's a
really cool idea for an engine like this which could work with current
tech (It was a 2013 project), but... funding, and anti-nuclear types who
hinder this :/

Solar sails, those take awhile unless you've got a huge (Like, HUGE)
freakin laser on both ends.

Then there's anti-matter, but that's impractical.

So... yeah, for now, chemical rockets will get us to Mars. They're not
the best, but they're the best we've got. We'll get better methods in
the future, especially if we begin voyages and even colonization there.
Plus, there's costs; which if it's too expensive, can sap support. Early
missions will need to be small, use current tech; and not do anything
too ambitious technology wise that could rack up the costs. That's a
good way to lose funding.
