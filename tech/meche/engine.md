# Overview

- An engine is a device that converts one form of energy into mechanical
  energy.
    + Heat engines: heat to work
        * Combustion engines: get heat from the combustion process
            - Internal combustion engines: MOST POPULAR
                + Cars, trucks, rocket
            - External combustion engines
            - Air-breathing combustion engines: (airplanes) using oxygen
              in atmospheric air to burn the fuel
        * Non-combustion engines
            - Nuclear power plant
            - Thermoacoustic heat engines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoacoustic_heat_engine
            - Stirling engines: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_engines
    + Electric engines: electrical energy
    + Pneumatic engines: compressed air
    + Hydraulic engines: pressurized liquid
    + Clockwork engines: elastic energy
    + Molecular engines: chemical energy (engines in living organisms)
