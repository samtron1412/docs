## The general meaning
- It gets the idea from "Bootstrapping process".
    + In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting
    process that is supposed to proceed without external input.
    + In computer technology the term (usually shortened to booting)
    usually refers to the process loading the basic software into the
    memory of a computer after power-on, especially the operating system
    kernel which will then take care of loading other software as
    needed.
