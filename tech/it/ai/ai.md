# Overview

- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines,
  in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other
  animals.
- In computer science AI research is defined as the study of
  "intelligent agents":
    + any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that
      maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.
- Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a
  machine mimics "cognitive" functions that humans associate with other
  human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving"

## Learning

- Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve
  automatically through experience.
    + *Unsupervised learning* is the ability to find patterns in a
      stream of input
    + *Supervised learning* includes both classification and numerical
      regression
        * *classification* is used to determine what category something
          belongs in, after seeing a number of examples of things from
          several categories.
        * *regression* is the attempt to produce a function that
          describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and
          predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change.
        * both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as
          *function approximators* trying to learn an unknown (possibly
          implicit) function
        * *reinforcement learning*
