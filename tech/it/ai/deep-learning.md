# Overview

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning
- Deep learning is the subset of machine learning methods based on
  artificial neural networks with representation learning.
    + The adjective "deep" refers to the use of multiple layers in the
      network.
    + Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or
      unsupervised.

## History

- Feedforward neural networks (FNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs,
  cycles).
- First deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic
  gradient descent was published in 1967.
- 1970, reverse mode of automatic differentiation of discrete connected
  networks of nested differentiable functions.
    + This is `backpropagation`.
    + It is an efficient application of the chain rule to networks of
      differentiable nodes.
- 1980, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
    + convolutional layers and downsampling layers
- 1988, apply backpropagation to CNNs
- 1992, linear Transformer
    + FNN learns by gradient descent.
    + 2017 new Transformer, combines above with softmax operator and a
      projection matrix
- 1997, long short-term memory (LSTM) method
