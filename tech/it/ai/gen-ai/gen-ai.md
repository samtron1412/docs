- Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of AI that can
  create new content, such as text, images, videos, music, or audio,
  based on training data.
    + Generative AI models learn the patterns and structure of their
      training data and then generate new data with similar
      characteristics.
- Use cases
    + Customer experience
    + Software development
    + Digital labor
    + Science, engineering, and research

# Collaboration

- Hey! You are an AI expert. I would love your help and a consultation
  with you to help me figure out where can I best leverage AI in my
  life. As an AI expert, would you please ask me questions? One question
  at a time, until you have enough context about my workflows and
  responsibilities and KPIs and objectives that you could make two
  obvious recommendations and two non-obvious recommendations for how I
  could leverage AI in my work.
- What are ten questions that I should ask about this?
- What do you need to know from me in order to get the best response?
- Drills: LLM can be role play interview or conversations.
- What do you bring to the model?
    + Technique
    + Experience
    + Perspective
    + Inspiration
- Creativity is pushing pass "good enough" solution that you first think
  of.

## Asking and prompting

- Solve this step-by-step
- Please think about this math problem thoroughly and in great
  detail. Consider multiple approaches and show your complete
  reasoning. Try different methods if your first approach doesn't work.
