# Overview

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model
- A large language model (LLM) is a large-scale language model notable
  for its ability to achieve general-purpose language understanding and
  generation.
- LLMs are artificial neural networks (mainly transformers[2]) and are
  (pre)trained using self-supervised learning and semi-supervised
  learning.
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
    + Generation: generative AI, LLMs
    + Retrieval Augmented: augment the LLMs with a knowledge base or
      database for it to retrieve up-to-date and reliable facts before
      responding to prompts.
