# Overview

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)
- A transformer is a deep learning architecture based on the multi-head
  attention mechanism.
- It is notable for not containing any recurrent units, and thus
  requires less training time than previous recurrent neural
  architectures, such as long short-term memory (LSTM).
