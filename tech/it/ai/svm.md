# Overview

- In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support
  vector networks) are
    + supervised learning models
    + with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for
      classification and regression analysis.
    + it is a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier.
- An SVM model is
    + a representation of the examples as points in space
    + mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided
      by a clear gap that is as wide as possible
    + new examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to
      belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall
- In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently
  perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel
  trick
    + implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature
      spaces
- When data is unlabelled, supervised learning is not possible
    + an unsupervised learning approach is required, which attempts to
      find natural clustering of the data to groups, and then map new
      data to these formed groups
    + The `support vector clustering` algorithm created by Hava
      Siegelmann and Valdimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support
      vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithms, to
      categorize unlabelled data.
