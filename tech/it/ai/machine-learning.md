# Overview

- A subset of artificial intelligence
- often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to
  *learn* (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task)
  with data, without being explicitly programmed.
    + data-driven predictions or decisions
- The term was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel
    + Evolved from the study of pattern recognition and computational
      learning theory in artificial intelligence

# Tasks

- Supervised Learning: the computer is presented with example inputs and
  their desired outputs
    + Semi-supervised learning: the computer is given only an incomplete
      training signal: a training set with some of the target outputs
      missing
    + Active learning: the computer can only obtain training labels for
      a limited set of instances
    + Reinforcement learning: training data (in form of rewards and
      punishments) is given only as feedback to the program's actions in
      a dynamic environment, such as driving a vehicle or playing a game
      against an opponent
- Unsupervised learning: no labels are given to the learning algorithm,
  leaving it on its own to find structure in its input.
    + can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data)
    + means towards an end (feature learning)
