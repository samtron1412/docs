# Overview
- Chromium is the open-source web browser project from which google Chrome draws its source code.
- Google's intention, as expressed in the developer documentation, was that Chromium would be the name of the open-source project and that the final product name would be Chrome.
- One of the major aims of the project is for Chromium to be a tabbed window manager, or shell for the web, as opposed to it being a traditional browser application.
- The application is designed to have a minimalist user interface.
