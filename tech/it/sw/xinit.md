# Overview
The `~/.xinitrc` file is a shell script read by xinit and by its front-end startx. It is mainly used to execute desktop environments, window managers and other programs when starting the X server (e.g., starting daemon and setting environment variables).

The xinit program starts the X Window System server and works as first client program on systems that are not using a display manager.
