# Overview

- Obtain a Decent Initial Configuration

The default configuration sucks. Luckily there is Emacs Prelude - Emacs
24 configuration that doesnâ€™t suck. I highly recommend you to use
Prelude as your initial Emacs config. Studying its source will give you
a bit of an insight into Emacs Lisp programming

- Read & Practice

```
first step - run the built-in Emacs tutorial - C-h t
second step - watch the excellent screencast Meet Emacs
third step - visit Mastering Emacs
forth step - read the official Emacs Manual - C-h r
fifth step - use Emacs day and night for all your work
```
