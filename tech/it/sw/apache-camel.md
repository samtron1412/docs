- Apache Camel is an open-source integration framework that facilitates
  the integration of various systems and applications by providing a
  standardized way to implement Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs).
- It enables developers to define routing and mediation rules in a
  variety of domain-specific languages (DSLs), such as Java, XML,
  Groovy, and Kotlin.
- Camel simplifies the process of connecting different systems,
  transforming data formats, and managing data flows between endpoints.
