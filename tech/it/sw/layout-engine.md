# Overview

A layout engine is a software component that combines content and
formatting information for electronic or printed display. Layout engines
can be found embedded in web browsers and reporting software, and
included in application frameworks that support a graphical user
interface.

Some applications combine layout engines with a parser that interprets
markup to get their content and formatting information, such as web
browsers.
