# TeX
TeX is a [typesetting system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting_system) designed and mostly written by [Donald Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) and released in 1978.

Together with the [Metafont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont) language for font description and the [Computer Modern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern) family of [typefaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeface), TeX was designed with two main goals in mind:

- Allow anybody to produce high-quality books using a reasonably minimal amount of effort.
- Provide a system that would give exactly the same results on all computers, now and in the future.

Written in originally [WEB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB) an [literate programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).


## Why TeX?
Eight reason in four areas: output quality (1), superior engineering (2-5), freedom (6-7) and popularity (8).

1. Best output
2. Fast
3. Stable
4. Input is plain text
5. Output can be anything
6. Free
7. Run anywhere
8. TeX is the standard

## Typesetting system
Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical [types](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting)) or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols (called [sorts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_(typesetting)) in mechanical systems and [glyphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyphs) in digital systems) are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for visual display. Typesetting requires the prior process of designing a [font](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font).

## WEB
WEB is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)": the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.

WEB consists of two secondary programs: `TANGLE`, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts, and `WEAVE`, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.

## Literate programming
Literate programming is an approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.

Literate programming is very often misunderstood to refer only to formatted documentation produced from a common file with both source code and comments – which is properly called `documentation generation` – or to voluminous commentaries included with code. This is backwards: well-documented code or documentation extracted from code follows the structure of the code, with documentation embedded in the code; in literate programming code is embedded in documentation, with the code following the structure of the documentation.

## TeX engines (binaries/executables)
### TeX (binary: *inittex*)
Originally TeX, current version is TeX version 3 'TeX90'
### e-TeX (binary: *etex*)
Released in the late 1990. Add number of additional primitives to TeX. Use by packages developer not end users.
### pdfTeX (binary: *pdftex*)
Write by Hàn Thế Thành in 1996. Include e-TeX and add number of PDF-related primitives. Can produce DVI and PDF.
### XeTeX (binary: *xetex*)
Include e-TeX, works with native UTF-8 input and can access system fonts.
### LuaTeX (binary: *luatex*)
Include e-TeX, works with native UTF-8 input and includes the Lua scripting engine, access system font by Lua.

## TeX macro packages (a.k.a TeX formats)
### Plain TeX (binary: *tex*)
Low-level than LaTeX

### [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) (binary: *latex*)
This tool provides several predefined document classes (book, article, report) with extensive sectioning and cross-referencing capabilities, and auxiliary tools for such processes as bibliography and index creation.

### [AMSTeX](http://www.ams.org/publications/authors/tex/tex)
AMS-TeX and AMS-LaTeX are macro collections developed at the American
Mathematical Society for preparing publications containing extensive
mathematical content. AMS-TeX works directly with TeX, and AMS-LaTeX
works on top of LaTeX.

As LaTeX increased in popularity, authors sought to submit papers to the AMS in LaTeX, so AMSLaTeX was developed. AMSLaTeX is a collection of LaTeX packages and classes that offer authors most of the functionality of AMSTeX. The AMS no longer recommends the use of AMSTeX, and urges its authors to use AMSLaTeX instead.

### [ConTeXt](http://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page) (binary: *texmfstart*)
ConTeXt is an independent macro package which has a basic document
structuring approach similar to LaTeX.  It also supports creating
interactive PDF files and has integrated MetaPost support, among many
other interesting features.

Whereas LaTeX insulates the writer from typographical details, ConTeXt takes a complementary approach by providing structured interfaces for handling typography, including extensive support for colors, backgrounds, hyperlinks, presentations, figure-text integration, and conditional compilation. It gives the user extensive control over formatting while making it easy to create new layouts and styles without learning the TeX macro language. ConTeXt’s unified design avoids the package clashes that can happen with LaTeX.

ConTeXt is a special case, straddling levels. It contains a format at the level of plain TeX and LaTeX, but unlike the other formats, it is invoked via a separate utility (e.g., texmfstart) which then indirectly runs a TeX engine. This makes it possible to support a wide array of advanced features, such as integrated graphics and XML input, since the startup utility can control the flow of processing.

### [TeXinfo](http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/) (binary: *makeinfo*)
Texinfo is the documentation format created by the GNU project. This macro set is designed to generate both print and on-line output (an "Info file", HTML, plain text, ...) from a single source file. Texinfo is integrated with GNU Emacs, and emacs can be used (but is not required) both to read Info files and create Texinfo source.

Texinfo is a macro language, somewhat similar to LaTeX, but with slightly less expressive power. Its appearance is of course rather similar to any TeX-based macro language, except that its macros start with @ rather than the \ that’s more commonly used in TeX systems.

### [Eplain](http://tug.org/eplain/) (Extended Plain TeX - binary: *eplain*)
Eplain is not intended to provide typesetting capabilities, as does LaTeX (originally written by Leslie Lamport) and Texinfo (Originally written by Richard Stallman). Instead, it provides definitions that are intended to be useful regardless of the high-level commands that you use when you actually prepare your manuscript.

For example, Eplain does not have a command \section to format section headings in an “appropriate” way, such as LaTeX’s \section. The philosophy of Eplain is that some people will always need or want to go beyond the macro designer’s idea of “appropriate”. Such canned macros are fine—as long as you are willing to accept the resulting output. If you don’t like the results, or if you are trying to match a different format, you have to put in extra work to override the defaults.


## TeX distribution
A TeX distribution provides a structured collection of TeX-related software. Generally, a TeX distribution includes a set of *“core”* TeX executables such as *tex* and *latex*; various *fonts* optimized for use with TeX; helper programs such as the *BibTeX* bibliographic-database formatter, editors, *integrated development environments*, file-format-conversion programs; numerous LaTeX *packages*; configuration tools; and any other goodies the distributor chooses to include.

Commonly encountered TeX distributions include [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) and [MacTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/); older ones include ozTeX, CMacTeX and teTeX. MiKTeX is also available as the basis of the ProTeXt bundle, distributed on the TeX Live DVD mailing, as well as being available online.

## Front-ends (Editors)
These editors are what you use to create a document file. Some (e.g., TeXShop) are devoted specifically to TeX, others (e.g., Emacs) can be used to edit any sort of file. TeX documents are independent of any particular editor; the TeX typesetting program itself does not include any sort of editor whatsoever.

## Packages
These are add-ons to the basic TeX system, developed independently, providing additional typesetting features, fonts, documentation, etc. A package might or might not work with any given format and/or engine; for example, many are designed specifically for LaTeX, but there are plenty of others, too. The [CTAN](http://www.ctan.org/) sites provide access to the vast majority of packages in the TeX world; CTAN is generally the source used by the distributions.

# Starting out with TeX, LaTeX and friends
## Get a distribution
Search Google "TeX distribution", find correspondent version with your platform. TeXLive cross-platform, MacTeX for Mac OS and MikTeX for Windows OS.

## Get a editor (front-ends)
Maybe TeX distribution have a editor default for you. If you don't like it, you can replace with another editor. Search Google "TeX editor" and choose your editor.

## Bibliography
### Back-end bibliography processor
#### [BibTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)
BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references. BibTeX was created by Oren Patashnik and Leslie Lamport in 1985. It is written in WEB/Pascal.
##### Basic structure
Input:

- An `.aux` file produced by LaTeX on an earlier run.
- A `.bst` file (the style file), which specifies the general reference-list style and specifies how to format individual entries, and which is written by a style designer [..] in a special-purpose language [..].
- A `.bib` file(s) create a database of all reference-list entries the user might ever hope to use.

BibTeX chooses from the `.bib` file(s) only those entries specified by the `.aux` file (that is, those given by LaTeX's `\cite` or `\nocite` commands), and creates as **output** a `.bbl` file containing these entries together with the formatting commands specified by the `.bst` file [..]. LaTeX will use the `.bbl` file, perhaps edited by the user, to produce the reference list.

`aux + bib -> bbl + bib -> ref list`

##### [Style examples](http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/software/latex/showbst.html)

##### [bib file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX#Bibliographic_information_file)
- Cross-referencing.
- Using more than one bib file.
- Non-reference section
	+ @COMMENT{...}


#### [Biber](http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/)
[manual](http://mirrors.ctan.org/biblio/biber/documentation/biber.pdf)

### Packages
- `\cite{cite_key}`
- `\cite[p.~215]{citation01}`
- `\cite{citation01,citation02,citation03}`
- `\nocite{citation01}` : ref appear in bibliography but not where it is ref in the main text.
