# Overview
**tar** is a computer software utility for collecting many files into one archive file, often referred to as a **tarball**. The name is derived from `Tape ARchiver`, as it was originally developed to write data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own.

The command line utility was first introduced in the seventh edition of UNIX (V7) in January 1979.

The file structure to store this information was later standardized in POSIX.
