# Overview
- TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space programs.
- It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical media, receives them from user space program and instead of sending packets via physical media writes them to the user space program.
