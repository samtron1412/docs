# Overview
In computing, a **virtual machine** (VM) is an **emulation** of a particular computer system. Virtual machines operate based on the **computer architecture** and functions of a real or hypothetical computer, and their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of both.

# Classification
## System virtual machine
A **system virtual machine** provides a complete system platform which supports the execution of a complete operating system (OS). These usually **emulate an existing architecture**, and are built with the purpose of either providing a platform to run programs where the real hardware is not available for use (for example, executing on otherwise obsolete platforms), or of having multiple instances of virtual machines leading to more **efficient use of computing resources**, both in terms of **energy consumption** and **cost effectiveness** (known as [hardware virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_virtualization), the key to a cloud computing environment), or both.

### Advantages
- Multiple OS environment, sharing files.
- Application provisioning, maintenance, high availablility and disaster recovry
- Multiple instruction set architecture (ISA)

### Disadvantage
- Less efficitent than actual machine
- Unstable performance

## Process virtual machine
A process virtual machine (also, **language virtual machine**) is designed to run a single program, which means that it supports a single process. Such virtual machines are usually closely suited to one or more programming languages and built with the purpose of providing program **portability** and **flexibility** (amongst other things). An essential characteristic of a virtual machine is that the software running inside is limited to the resources and abstractions provided by the virtual machineâ€”it cannot break out of its virtual environment.

# Techniques
## Virtualization of the underlying raw hardware (native execution)
[Hardware-assisted virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization)

This approach is full virtualization of the hardware, and can be implemented using a Type 1 or Type 2 [hypervisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor)

The standard **x86 processor architecture** as used in the modern PCs does not actually meet the [Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popek_and_Goldberg_virtualization_requirements). Notably, there is no **execution mode** where all sensitive machine instructions always trap, which would allow **per-instruction virtualization**.

Intel and AMD have introduced features to their x86 processors to enable [virtualization in hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization).
