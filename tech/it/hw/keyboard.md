# Overview

A keyboard is a typewriter-style device, which uses an arrangement of
buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.

# Keyboard Layout

A keyboard layout is any specific mechanical, visual, or functional
arrangement of the keys, legends, or key-meaning associations
(respectively) of a computer, typewriter, or other typographic keyboard.

**Mechanical layout**
The placements and keys of a keyboard.

**Visual layout** The arrangement of the legends (labels, markings,
engravings) that appear on the keys of a keyboard.

**Functional layout** The arrangement of the key-meaning associations,
determined in software, of all the keys of a keyboard.

# Technology

Computer keyboards can be classified by the switch technology that they
use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80â€“110 durable
switches, one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key
response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and travel
(the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably).
Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve
greater cost savings.
