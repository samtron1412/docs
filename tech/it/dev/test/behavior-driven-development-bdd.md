# Overview

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an Agile software development
methodology that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and a shared
understanding of software features from a user's perspective. It uses a
simple, natural language format to define and automate tests based on
expected behaviors, helping to bridge the gap between technical and
non-technical team members and ensure the software delivers business
value by focusing on user experience and functionality.

- BDD can be combined with TDD
    + BDD can be used to write test for the high level expected behaviors.
    + And TDD can be used to drive each single component implementation.

# Feature file

A .feature file is a plain-text file using the Gherkin language that
describes a software feature's behavior in a human-readable format,
specifying preconditions, actions, and expected outcomes for automated
testing. Used in Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) frameworks like
Cucumber, it outlines test scenarios that serve as executable
specifications and documentation for the application's functionality.
