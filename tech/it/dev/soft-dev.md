# Software development life cycle/process/methodology/model

- In recent years, industry adopted a holistic view of a software
  development team where development teams communicate more with
  stakeholders / users including operation teams.
- A modern software engineer is an IT generalist who should have a
  wide-ranging knowledge of both development and operations, including
  coding, infrastructure management, system administration, and DevOps
  toolchains.
    + DevOps engineers should also possess interpersonal skills since
      they work across company silos to create a more collaborative
      environment.

## Agile

- Agile software development
    + https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development
- Agile software development values
    + Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    + Working software over comprehensive documentation
    + Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    + Responding to change over following a plan
- Agile software development principles: 12
    + Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
    + Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
    + Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
    + Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
    + Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
    + Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
    + Working software is the primary measure of progress
    + Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
    + Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
    + Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
    + Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
    + Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

## DevOps

- https://www.atlassian.com/devops
- DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the
  processes between software development and system operation teams, so
  they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
    + Integrate the development and operation teams
- History
    + The DevOps movement started to coalesce some time between 2007 and
      2008
- Going beyond Agile
    + Agile methodologies help teams plan and produce by breaking work
      down into manageable tasks and milestones.
        * https://www.atlassian.com/agile
    + Continuous integration and delivery: automating the merging and
      deployment of code.
        * https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery
    + Git repositories and workflows
        * https://www.atlassian.com/git
    + Incident management: responding to issues and trouble tickets
        * https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management
- Benefits of DevOps
    + Collaborating and trust
    + Release faster and work smarter
    + Accelerate time-to-resolution
    + Better manage unplanned work: better Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)
      when incidents and outages occur
- DevOps culture
    + Transparency, communication, and collaboration
    + Shared responsibilities
    + Fast feedback
    + Automation
