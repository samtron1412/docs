# Overview

- A software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a
  commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
- It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into
  source or machine code.
- Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem
  that can be used in many different situations.
- Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can
  use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
