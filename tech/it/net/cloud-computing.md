# Overview

- https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/
    + Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the
      Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning,
      and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access
      technology services, such as computing power, storage, and
      databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon
      Web Services (AWS).
    + Types
        * Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): networking features,
          computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage
          space.
            - The most flexible, but also the most operational load.
        * Platform as a Service (PaaS): PaaS removes the need for you to
          manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and
          operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment
          and management of your applications.
            - Lambda, Fargate, etc.
        * Software as a Service (SaaS)
            - SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and
              managed by the service provider. (e.g., web-based services
              such as Cloud9 - IDE, Office 365, Google Docs, etc.)
