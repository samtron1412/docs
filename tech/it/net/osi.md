# Overview

- The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual
  model that 'provide[s] a common basis for the coordination of [ISO]
  standard development from the purpose of system interconnection'.
- In the OSI reference model, the communications between a computing
  system are split into seven different abstraction layers:
    + Physical,
    + Data Link,
    + Network,
    + Transport,
    + Session,
    + Presentation,
    + Application.
- Alternative **TCP/IP model**:
    + Link layer (Physical and Data Link),
    + Internet layer (Network)
    + Transport layer
    + Application layer (Session, Presentation and Application)
