# Overview

- Computer network
    + Origin: 1950s, Internet: 1970s
    + Network packet: control information + user data (payload)
    + Network topology: layouts (bus, star, etc.)
    + Network links:
        * Wired: coaxial cable, twisted pair, optical fiber
        * Wireless: bluetooth, wifi, NFC, etc.
    + Network nodes
        * Network interface controllers (NIC)
        * Repeaters, hubs
        * Bridges, switches
        * Routers
        * Modems
    + Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model: conceptual model

# Socket

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_socket
    + A network socket is a software structure (usually a triad of
      transport protocol, IP address, and port number) within a network
      node of a computer network that serves as an endpoint for sending
      and receiving data across the network.
    + The structure and properties of a socket are defined by an
      application programming interface (API) for the networking
      architecture.
- https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/definition.html
    + A socket is one endpoint of a two-way communication link between
      two programs running on the network.
    + A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer can
      identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.
