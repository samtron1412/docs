# Overview

- A Request for Comments (RFC) is a publication in a series from the
  principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the
  Internet, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
    + An RFC is authored by individuals or groups of engineers and
      computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing
      methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the
      working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems.
    + It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts,
      information, or, occasionally, engineering humor.
