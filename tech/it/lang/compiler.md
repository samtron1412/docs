# Overview

- A compiler is a computer program that transforms source code written
  in a programming language into another computer language with the
  latter often having a binary form known as object code.
- The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate
  source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level
  language (e.g., assembly language or machine code).
