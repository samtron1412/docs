# Overview

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the
concept of "objects," which may contain data, in the form of fields,
often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often
known as methods.
- A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access adn
  often modify the data fields of the object with which they are
  associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self").
- In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects
  that interact with one another.
- There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular
  ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes,
  which typically also determine their type.
