# Overview

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a software library for the C++
programming language that influenced many parts of the C++ Standard
Library.
- It provides four components called algorithms, containers, functors,
  and iterators.
- The STL achieves its results through the use of templates. This
  approach provides compile-time polymorphism that is often more
  efficient than traditional run-time polymorphism.
- Modern C++ compilers are tuned to minimize abstraction penalties
  arising from heavy use of the STL.
- The STL was created as the first library of generic algorithms and
  data structures for C++, with four ideas in mind:
    + generic programming
    + abstractness without loss of efficiency
    + the Von Neumann computation model
    + and value semantics
