# Overview

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-
independent application programming interface that treats an HTML,
XHTML, or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an
object representing a part of the document.

- The object can be manipulated programmatically and any visible changes
  occurring as a result may then be reflected in the display of the
  document.
