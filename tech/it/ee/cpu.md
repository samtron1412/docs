# Overview

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuit that carries
out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic
arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified
by the instructions.
- Control unit (CU)
- Processing unit: ALU and registers
- Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, meaning they are contained on a
  single integrated circuit (IC) chip.
- A multi-core processor is a single chip containing two or more CPUs
  called "cores."
- An IC that contains one or more CPUs, memory, and peripheral
  interfaces are called microcontroller or systems on a chip (SoC)
