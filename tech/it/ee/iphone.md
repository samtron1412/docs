- iPhone: 5V * 1A = 5W
- iPad: 5V * 2.1A = 10W or 5V * 2.4A = 12W

## Sensors
### Proximity Sensor
This sensor can determine how close the iPhone is to your face. This sensor is what helps the iPhone turn off its screen automatically whenever you hold the phone up to your ear. This is necessary to prevent accidental button clicks by the side of your head when talking.

### Motion sensor/Accelerometer
This sensor enables the iPod touch, iPad, or iPhoneâ€™s screen to automatically switch from landscape to portrait modes and back again based on whether you're holding the phone up and down or sideways.

### Ambient light sensor
This sensor can determine how much light is available in the area surrounding the iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad and automatically adjust the brightness of the screen in order to conserve battery life.

### Gyroscope
Starting with the iPhone 4, 4th gen. iPod touch, and iPad 2 there's another sensor: a three-axis gyroscope. When combining the gyroscope with the accelerometer, this gives these devices six axes on which the it can operate. This is designed to make them more sensitive, responsive, and powerful for gaming

### Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode
#### What is Device Firmware Update mode?
Put iPhone, or other iOS device, into that allows you make very low level modifications to the software running the device.

When an iOS device is in DFU mode, the device is powered on, but hasn't yet booted up the operating system. As a result, you can make changes to the operating system itself that you wouldn't otherwise be able to.

#### When Use It?
- Downgrading
- Jailbreak

#### How to enter DFU mode?
Putting a device into DFU mode is similar to recovery mode, but not quite as easy. It took me at least half a dozen tries to get the hang of it, so don't be discouraged if you can't make it work right away. Most likely your problem is coming during step 4. That was the source of my difficulty, but once I learned to be more patient, everything worked fine.

Begin by connecting your iPhone or other iOS device to your computer.
Turn off the device by holding down the sleep/power button in the top right corner and the Home button on the front button of the device at the same time. A red slider will appear. Slide it to the right to turn off the device. Alternatively, keep holding both buttons even after the slider appears and the device will turn off. Let go of the buttons when the device powers down.
With the device off, once again hold down the sleep/power and Home buttons at the same time.
Hold these buttons for 10 seconds. This is the crucial step. Be patient and slow with your count. If you count too quickly and let go before 10 full seconds have passed, you'll enter recovery mode instead of DFU mode.
After 10 seconds have passed, let go of the sleep/power button, but keep holding the Home Button.
The Apple logo will appear on the device's screen, but keep holding the Home button until the recovery mode warning pops up in iTunes. Then you can let go of the Home button.
If your device's screen is black, you're in DFU Mode. It may appear that the device is turned off, but it's not.
If you're in recovery mode (indicated by a graphic of a cable connecting to the iTunes icon) or have booted up your device, repeat these steps.
Other means to enter DFU Mode include non-iTunes software tools.

#### How to Exit It
To exit iPhone DFU Mode, you can just turn off the device. Do this by holding down the sleep/power and Home buttons until the slider appears or, if you hold it longer, the device turns off and the screen goes dark.


## [Back up](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1766)
### Location your back up file
The location of the iPhone backup files generated in iTunes is the following directory:

Windows XP:
`\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\`

Windows Vista or Windows 7:
`\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup\`

Replace USERNAME with your personal account name.
