# Overview

A keyboard is a typewriter-style device, which uses an arrangement of
buttons or keys, to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches.

# Keyboard Layout

A keyboard layout is any specific mechanical, visual, or functional
arrangement of the keys, legends, or key-meaning associations
(respectively) of a computer, typewriter, or other typographic keyboard.

**Mechanical layout**
The placements and keys of a keyboard.

**Visual layout** The arrangement of the legends (labels, markings,
engravings) that appear on the keys of a keyboard.

**Functional layout** The arrangement of the key-meaning associations,
determined in software, of all the keys of a keyboard.

# Technology

Computer keyboards can be classified by the switch technology that they
use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80–110 durable
switches, one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key
response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and travel
(the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably).
Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve
greater cost savings.
