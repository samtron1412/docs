# Common

## Information Science

Information science is an interdisciplinary field primarily concerned
with the analysis, collection, classification, manipulation, storage,
retrieval, movement, dissemination, and protection of information.

Practitioners study application and usage of knowledge in organizations
along with the interaction between people, organizations and any
existing information systems with the aim of creating, replacing,
improving, or understanding information systems.

## Information Technology

Information technology is the application of computers to store, study,
retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, or information, often in the
context of a business or other enterprise.

## Computer

A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary
set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.

## Computer Science

- Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and
  engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
- Computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes
  that scale.
- It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its
  applications.
- It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression,
  and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that
  underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage,
  communication of, and access to information.

## Computer Engineering

Computer engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of
electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer
hardware and software.
- A little focus on hardware


# Hardware

## Computer Hardware Engineering

- Most computer hardware engineers research, develop, design, and test
  various computer equipment.
- This can range from circuit boards and microprocessors to routers.

## Computer Hardware

Computer hardware is the collection of physical components that
constitute a computer system.
- Computer hardware is the physical parts or components of a computer,
such as monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, graphic card, sound
card, motherboard, etc.

## Mechanical Computer

A mechanical computer is built from mechanical components such as levers
and gears, rather than electronic components.
- The most common examples are adding machines and mechanical counters,
  which use the turning of gears to increment output displays.

## Integrated Circuit

An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also referred to
as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic circuits on one
small flat piece of semiconductor material, normally silicon.
- The integration of large numbers of tiny transistors into a small chip
  resulted in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper,
  and faster than those constructed of discrete electronic components.
- Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed
  as a unit by photolithography rather than being constructed one
  transistor at a time. Furthermore,packaged ICs use much less material
  than discrete circuits.
- Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and
  consume little power because of their small size and close proximity.
- The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to design them and
  fabricate the required photomasks.

## Logic gate

In electronics, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device
implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical
operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary
output.
- Logic gates are primarily implemented using diodes or transistors
  acting as electronic switches, but can also be constructed using
  vacuum tubes, electromagnetic relays, fluidic logic, pneumatic logic,
  optics, molecules, or even mechanical elements.
- Logic gates allow the construction of a physical model of all of
  Boolean logic, and all of the algorithms and mathematics that can be
  described with Boolean logic.
- In modern practice, most gates are made from field-effect transistors
  (FETs), particularly MOSFETs (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
  transistors).
- Compound logic gates AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert (OAI) are
  often employed in circuit design because their construction using
  MOSFETs is simpler and more efficient than the sum of the individual
  gates.
- In reversible logic (reversible computing), Toffoli gates are used.

## Processor

In computing, a processor or processing unit is an electronic circuit
which performs operations on some external data source, usually memory
or some other data stream.
- The term is frequently used to refer to the central processing unit
  (CPU) in a system, but typical computer systems or a system on chip
  (SoC - microcontroller) combine many specialized processors.
- Examples: CPU - Central processing unit, GPU - Graphics processing
  unit, Sound chip, PPU - Physics processing unit, etc.

## Central Processing Unit (CPU)

A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuit that carries
out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic
arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified
by the instructions.
- Control unit (CU)
- Processing unit: ALU and registers
- Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, meaning they are contained on a
  single integrated circuit (IC) chip.
- A multi-core processor is a single chip containing two or more CPUs
  called "cores."
- An IC that contains one or more CPUs, memory, and peripheral
  interfaces are called microcontroller or systems on a chip (SoC)

## Microcontroller - System on Chip (SoC)

- A microcontroller (or MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small
  computer on a single integrated circuit built for the purpose of
  dealing with specific tasks, such as displaying information in a
  microwave LED or receiving information from a television's remote
  control.
- In modern terminology, it is a system on chip or SoC.
- A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs along with memory and
  programmable input/output peripherals.


## Computer Architecture

In computer engineering, computer architecture is a set of rules and
methods that describe the functionality, organization, and
implementation of computer systems.


## Multiplexer

- In electronics, a multiplexer (or mux) is a device that selects on of
  several analog or digital input signals and forwards the selected
  input into a single line.
    + An electronic multiplexer makes it possible for several signals to
      share one device or resource instead of having one device per
      input signal.
- Conversely, a demultiplexer (demux) is a device taking a single input
  and selecting one of many data-output-lines, which is connected to the
  single input.

# Software

## Computer Software Engineering

Software engineering is the application of engineering to the
development of software in a systematic method.
- Computer software engineers develop, design, and test software.
- They construct, and maintain computer programs, as well as set up
  networks.

## Computer Software

Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system
that consists of data and/or computer instructions, in contract to the
physical hardware from which the system is built.

## Binary number

In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number
expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which
represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 and
1.
- Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic
  circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by
  almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.
- Each digit is referred to as a bit.
- The modern binary number system was devised by Gottfried Leibniz in
  1679.
- Systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple
  cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was
  specifically inspired by the Chinese I Ching.
- In 1854, British mathematician George Boole published a landmark paper
  detailing an algebraic system of logic that would become known as
  Boolean algebra.
- In 1937, Claude Shannon produced his master's thesis at MIT that
  implemented Boolean algebra and binary arithmetic using electronic
  relays and switches for the first time in history.

## Boolean Algebra

In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of
algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values "true"
and "false", usually denoted "1" and "0" respectively.
- Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are
  numbers, and the prime operations are addition and multiplication, the
  main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction "AND", the
  disjunction "OR", and the negation "NOT."
- It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same
  way that ordinary algebra describes numeric relations.
- Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book *The
  Mathematical Analysis of Logic* (1987), and set forth more fully in
  his *An Investigation of the Laws of Thought* (1854).

## Bit

The bit used to denote either
1. the basic and physical unit of information in computing and digital
   communications or
2. a binary digit.

- A binary digit can have only one or two values, and may therefore be
  physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most
  commonly represented as either a 0 or 1.
- The two values of a binary digit can also be interpreted as logical
  values (true/false, yes/no), algebraic signs (+/-), activation states
  (on/off), or any other two-valued attribute.

## General-purpose Programming Language

In computer software a general-purpose programming language is a
programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide
variety of application domains.

## Domain-specific Language

A domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within
a specific application domain.

## Page Description Language

A page description language (PDL) is a language that describes the
appearance of a printed page in a higher level than an actual output
bitmap. An overlapping term is printer control language, which includes
Hewlett-Packard's PCL. PostScript is one of the most noted page
description languages. PDF, SVG...

## Markup Language

A (document) markup language is a modern system for annotating a
document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.
HTML, XML, TeX, ...

## Toy Language

A toy language is a term for a computer programming language that is not
considered to fulfill the *robustness* or *completeness* requirement of
a computer programming language. As such it is not considered a suitable
language for creating *solid* and *reliable* programs for use in
production environments.

## Esolang

An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a
programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer
programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, or
as a joke.

## Dynamic Programming Language

`Dynamic programming language` is a term used in computer science to
describe a class of *high-level programming languages* which, at
*runtime*, execute many common programming behaviors that static
programming languages perform during compilation. Dynamic languages are
frequently (but not always) referred to as “scripting languages”. List
of popular dynamic programming language: Javascript, Objective-C, Perl,
PHP, Powershell, Python, Ruby.

## Hooking

Kind of event handler, use call back function or some code to handles
events. When something happens, hook will trigger some code that allows
you to tap in to a module provide different behavior.

## Callback

A callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument
to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at
some convenient time.

Programming languages support callbacks in different ways, often
implementing them with subroutines, lambda expressions, blocks, or
function pointers.

## Failover

Failover means when a system fail it will switching to a redundant or
standby system.

## Failback

Failback is a process of restoring the application in a state of
failover back to its original state (before failure).

## Scrobble - a.k.a. scrobbling

- To find other people who share similar interests.
- To scrobble a song means that when you listen to it, the name of the
  song is sent to a Web site (e.g. Last.fm, Libre.fm) and added to your
  music profile.
- Last.fm or Libre.fm like a social music network, once you start
  scrobbling yourself, you can see what artists you really listen to the
  most, view your listening habits on your profile page, and allow
  others to see your tastes in music. These companies use this data to
  organize and recommend music to people, to create personalized radio
  stations, and to see what other users listened to the most.


## Race condition

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition

A race condition is the behavior of an electronics, software, or other
system where the output is dependent on the sequence or timing of other
uncontrollable events.

It becomes a bug (produces wrong results) when events do not happen in
the order the programmer intended.

=> Fixing by mutual exclusion (locking), synchronization, etc.

## Deadlock

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock

A deadlock is a state in which each member of a group is waiting for
some other member to take action, such as sending a message or more
commonly releasing a lock.

In an operating system, a deadlock occurs when a process or thread
enters a waiting state because a requested system resource is held by
another waiting process, which in turn is waiting for another resource
held by another waiting process. If a process is unable to change its
state indefinitely because the resources requested by it are being used
by another waiting process, then the system is said to be in a deadlock

## Resource Starvation

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)

In computer science, starvation is a problem encountered in concurrent
computing where a process **is perpetually denied** necessary resources
to process its work (lack of needed resources).

# Computer Science

## Automata Theory

Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well
as the computational problems that can be solved using them.
- It is a theory in theoretical computer science and discrete
  mathematics (a subject study in both mathematics and computer science)
- The word automata (the plural of automaton) comes from the Greek word,
  which means "self-acting."

### Abstract Machine

An abstract machine, also called an abstract computer, is a theoretical
model of a computer hardware or software system used in automata theory.

### Turing Machine

A Turing machine is an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a
strip of tape according to a table of rules; to be more exact, it is a
mathematical model of computation that defines such a device.
- Giving any computer algorithm, a Turing machine can be constructed
  that is capable of simulating that algorithm's logic.
