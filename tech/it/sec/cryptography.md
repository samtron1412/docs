## Cryptography aspects
- **Theory**: stydying cryptography and understanding the limits of cryptography-what can and can't be done and why. This often requires understanding of theoretical computer science(i.e. complexity theory and algorithms) and math(i.e. probability theory, combinatorics and algebra).
- **Design**: constructing efficient primities and protocols. This usually requires understanding of crypto theory and math(espectially number theory and algebra)
- **Engineering**: implementing the promitives and protocols securely and efficiently and about integrating them in larger useful systems. This usually requires an understanding of crypto design, algorithms, and data structures, software engineering and system design/enfineering.

## Crypto Abstractions
pseudo language help focus on design

### Limitations
- Jump from design to engineering harder.
- Efficiency
- Security: [side-channel attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack)

## How to do it
The best strategy for learning crypto design and theory is to get a Ph.D at a University with a cryptography group.

## Hot Not to do it
### Developing mathematical maturity




### Learning how to debug




### Acquiring the basics
