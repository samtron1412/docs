# Overview

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
- Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a
  cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys.
- Each pair consists of a public key (which may be known to others) and
  a private key (which may not be known by anyone except the owner).
- In such a system, any person can encrypt a message using the intended
  receiver's public key, but that encrypted message can only be
  decrypted with the receiver's private key.
- Often, asymmetric encryption is used to securely exchange a secret key
  which is then used for symmetric encryption.
