## Cryptography aspects

- **Theory**:
    + stydying cryptography and understanding the limits of
      cryptography-what can and can't be done and why.
    + This often requires understanding of theoretical computer
      science(i.e. complexity theory and algorithms) and
      math(i.e. probability theory, combinatorics and algebra).
- **Design**:
    + constructing efficient primities and protocols.
    + This usually requires understanding of crypto theory and
      math(espectially number theory and algebra)
- **Engineering**:
    + implementing the promitives and protocols securely and efficiently
      and about integrating them in larger useful systems.
    + This usually requires an understanding of crypto design,
      algorithms, and data structures, software engineering and system
      design/enfineering.

## Crypto Abstractions

pseudo language help focus on design

### Limitations

- Jump from design to engineering harder.
- Efficiency
- Security: [side-channel attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack)

## How to do it

The best strategy for learning crypto design and theory is to get a Ph.D
at a University with a cryptography group.

## Hot Not to do it

### Developing mathematical maturity




### Learning how to debug




### Acquiring the basics
