# Glossary
- Tail call: It is when compiler (or interpreter) transforms recursion (with which it is possible: tail recursion) into iteration for efficiency: [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call. 13)
- callee: a function being called by another.
- caller: a function calling another.
- compiler intrinsic:  A function specific to a compiler which is not usual library function. Compiler generate a specific machine code instead of call to it. It is often a pseudofunction for specific CPU instruction.
- CP/M: Control Program for Microcomputers: a very basic disk OS used before MS-DOS
- debuggee: a program being debugged
- dongle: Dongle is a small piece of hardware connected to LPT printer port (in past) or to USB. Its function was akin to security token, it has some memory and, sometimes, secret (crypto-)hashing algorithm
- endianness: byte order
- leaf function: a function which is not calling any other function
- link register: (RISC) A register where return address is usually stored. This makes calling leaf functions without stack usage, i.e., faster..
- Windows NT: Windows NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8
- xoring: applying XOR operation
- name mangling: (also called `name decoration`) is a technique used to solve various problems caused by the need to resolve unique names for programming entities in many modern programming languages. It provides a way of encoding additional information in the name of a **function, structure, class** or another datatype in order to pass more semantic information from the compilers to **linkers**.

# Fundamentals
## Signed number representations
There are several methods of representing signed number, but in x86 architecture used "two's complement".

### Integer overflow

## Endianness
Endianness is a way of representing values in memory.
### Big-endian
Value 0x12345678 will be presented in memory: 0x12 0x34 0x56 0x78. Motorola 68k, IBM POWER.

### Little-endian
Value 0x12345678 will be presented in memory: 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12. Intel x86.

### Bi-endian
CPUs which may switch between endianness: ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, MIPS, IA64, etc.
# Finding important/interesting stuff in the code
One of the primary reverse engineerâ€™s task is to find quickly in the code what is needed.

`IDA` disassembler allow us search among text strings, byte sequences, constants. It is even possible to export the code
into `.lst` or `.asm` text file and then use `grep, awk, etc.`

When you try to understand what a code is doing, this easily could be some open-source library like libpng. So when you see some constants or text strings looks familiar, it is always worth to google it. And if you find the open-source project where it is used, then it will be enough just to compare the functions. It may solve some part of problem.

For example, if program use a XML files, the first step may be determining, which XML-library is used for processing, since
standard (or well-known) library is usually used instead of self-made one.

## Identification of executable files
### Microsoft Visual C++
MSVC versions and DLLs which may be imported. msvcp*.dll contain C++-related functions, so, if it is imported, this is probably C++ program.

Name mangling: Names are usually started with `?` symbol.

### GCC
Aside from *NIX targets, GCC is also present in win32 environment: in form of Cygwin and MinGW.

Name mangling: Names are usually started with `_Z` symbols.

Cygwin: `cygwin1.dll` is often imported.

MinGW: `msvcrt.dll` may be imported.
