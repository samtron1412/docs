# Overview

A computer terminal is an electronic or electromechanical hardware
device that is used for **entering data into, and displaying data
from,** a computer or a computing system.

The system console, computer console, or simply console is the text
entry and display device for **system administration messages**. The
system console is a computer terminal.

So a computer terminal is bigger set than system console, a computer
terminal can be a system console or not. Computer terminal more
functions than system console.

A **virtual console** (VC) – also known as a **virtual terminal** (VT) -
consoles that are logically separate, but which access the same physical
keyboard and display.

- Linux kernel supports virtual consoles and the Linux console (and
  Linux virtual consoles) are implemented by the VT subsystem of the
  Linux kernel, and do not rely on any user space software. This is in
  contrast to a **terminal emulator**, which is a user space process
  that emulates a terminal, and is typically used in a graphical display
  environment.

A **terminal emulator** is a program that emulates a terminal within
some other display architecture.

- Terminal emulators show a GUI Window that contains a terminal.
- Most of them emulate Xterm, which in turn emulates VT102, which
  emulates typewriter.
