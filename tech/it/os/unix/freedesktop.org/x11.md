# Overview

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)

X Window System (X11, or shortened to simply X, and sometimes informally
X-Windows) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on
UNIX-like computer operating systems.

X provides the basic framework for a GUI environment: drawing and moving
windows on the display device and interacting with a mouse and
keyboard. X does not control the user interface - this is handled by
individual programs.

X originated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in
1984. The protocol has been version 11 since September 1987.

      and resize windows, etc. using X11's XTEST extension and other
      Xlib functions.
    + To enable XTEST extension for XQuartz
        * `defaults write org.x.X11 enable_test_extensions -boolean true`
