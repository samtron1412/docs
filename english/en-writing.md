# Overview
How to write and the right way to write.

# Write an email - email etiquette
## Format
- Greeting
- Who you are?
- Your reason for writing
- Closing
- Signature

## Rules
### Greeting
- Starting email with: `Dear`, `Hello`, `Hi`
- Using first name in regular workplace, some upper-level prefer `Mr.` or `Ms.`, using `Dr.` for a medical doctor or professor for the first time. If you don't have a specific name for the recipient, a simple `Hello` is perfectly sufficient.

### Closing
- `Best`: easy to use
- `Best regards`: This phrase is professional, but with some warmth. It's common for business emails that are less formal, such as between co-workers who work together somewhat frequently. This can be shortened further to `Regards` when emailing someone familiar.
- `Sincerely`: This is a universal closing sentiment and appropriate in most situations, little bit old-fashion.
- `Thanks`: more familiar
- `Thanks so much`
- `Many thanks`
- `Thank you`: more formal
- `Respectfully`: This is a formal sendoff that's appropriate when emailing the CEO, Chairman of the Board, or a high-level company executive.
- `Fondly`: This is definitely a social closing, not a professional one, a level of familiarity.
- `Warm regards`: This is a more formal version of `fondly`, but it's still best suited for social emails.
- `Hope this helps`

### Signature
Make sure your signature line lists the basics: your full name, title, company name, and contact information, including phone numbers and email.

## Write an email to a professor
[How](http://www.wikihow.com/Email-a-Professor)

### Example
	Dear Professor XXX,

	I am a student at XXX College with a major in xxx.  I am a junior and will be graduating next May.  I have a 4.0 GPA and experience in our college’s summer program in xxx.

	I am planning to attend graduate school in xxx, with a focus on xxx.  In one of my classes, “xxx,” which was taught by Professor XXX, I had the chance to read your article, “xxxx.”  I really enjoyed it, and it gave me many ideas for my future research.  I have been exploring graduate programs where I can work on this topic.

	I hope you don’t mind my getting in touch, but I’d like to inquire whether you are currently accepting graduate students.  And if you are, if you’d be willing to talk to me a bit more, by email or on the phone, or in person if I can arrange a campus visit, about my graduate school plans.  I have explored your department’s graduate school website in detail, and it seems like an excellent fit for me because of its emphasis on xx and xx,  but I still have a few specific questions about xx and xxx that I’d like to talk to you about.

	I know you’re very busy so I appreciate any time you can give me.  Thanks very much,

	Sincerely,

	XX XXX

# Tips and Tricks
## past model verbs - could have, should have, would have
### could have + past participle
- could have + past participle means that something was possible in the past, or you had the ability to do something in the past, but that you didn't do it.
	+ I could have stayed up late, but I decided to go to bed early.
	+ They could have won the race, but they didn't try hard enough.
	+ Julie could have bought the book, but she borrowed it from the library instead.
	+ He could have studied harder, but he was too lazy and that's why he failed the exam.
- coudn't have + past participle means that something wasn't possible in the past, even if you had wanted to do it.
	+ I couldn't have arrived any earlier. There was a terrible traffic jam.
	+ He couldn't have passed the exam, even if he had studied harder. It's a really, really difficult exam.
- we want to make a guess about something that happened in the past. In this case, we don't know if what we're saying is true or not true. We're just talking about our opinion of what maybe happened.
	+ Why is John late? He could have got stuck in traffic.
	+ He could have forgotten that we were meeting today.
	+ He could have overslept.
- We can also choose to use `might have + past participle` to make a guess about something that happened in the past.
	+ He might have got stuck in traffic
	+ He might have forgotten that we were meeting today.
	+ He might have got stuck in traffic.

### Should have + past participle
- `should have + past participle` can mean something that would have been a good idea, but that you didn't do it. It's like giving advice about the past when you say it to someone else, or regretting what you did or didn't do when you're talking about yourself.
	+ I should have studied harder! (= I didn't study very hard and so I failed the exam. I'm sorry about this now.)
	+ I should have gone to bed early (= I didn't got to bed early and now I'm tired.)
- `shouldn't have + past participle` means that something wasn't a good idea, but you did it anyway.
	+ I shouldn't have eaten so much cake! (= I did eat a lot of cake and now i don't feel good.)
- `should have + past participle` to talk about something that, if everything is normal and okay, we think has already happened. But we're not certain that everything is fine, so we use 'should have' and not the present perfect or past simple. It's often used with 'by now'.
	+ His plane should have arrived by now (= if everything is fine, the plane has arrived).
	+ John should have finished work by now (= if everything is normal, John has finished work).
	+ Lucy should have arrived by now, but she hasn't.

### would have + past participle
- part of the `third conditional`
	+ If I had had enough money, I would have bought a car (but I didn't have enough money, so I didn't buy a car).
- to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't
	+ I would have gone to the party, but I was really busy. (= I wanted to go to the party, but I didn't because I was busy. If I hadn't been so busy, I would have gone to the party.)
	+ I would have called you, but I didn't know your number. (= I wanted to call you but I didn't know your number, so I didn't call you.)
	+ A: Nobody volunteered to help us with the fair
	+ B: I would have helped you. I didn't know you needed help. (= If I had known that you needed help, I would have helped you.)

## Position of `sometimes`
IMHO, meaning of your sentence depends on where you put the word "sometimes". Wherever you put it, it'll emphasise the words following it. I would interpret it as follows:

- **SOMETIMES it's good to go to the church** or **It's SOMETIMES good to go to the church** [implies a continuation like "...rather than stay in bed until noon"; here "SOMETIMES" relates to "good to go"]. (`This is more common`)

- "It's good to go SOMETIMES to the church" ["...and sometimes to the mosque", here "SOMETIMES" refers to "the church"].

- "It's good to go to the church SOMETIMES" ["... but not too often", "SOMETIMES" acts on its own]

**Some examples**

	I [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] like to answer questions about adverbs.
	I have [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] liked to answer questions about adverbs.
	I can [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
	I am [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.

You can add sometimes to any of the four lists above, but not to any of the four below.

	I do not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
	I have not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answered questions about adverbs.
	I can't [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
	I am not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.

You can place sometimes at the beginning of any of the eight examples above.
