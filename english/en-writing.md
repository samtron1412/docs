# Fundamentals of Effective Writings
## An Introduction to Writing
Writing consists basically of making a point and then providing evidence to support or develop that point.
+ What is your point?
+ What is your support for that point?

Four basic principles:
1. **Unity**: start with a clearly stated point.
2. **Support**: provide logical, detailed support for your point.
3. **Coherence**: organize and connect your supporting material.
4. **Sentence Skills**: revise and edit so that your sentences are effective and error-free.

Benefits of Paragraph Writing
- Mastering the structure of paragraphs will make me a better writer.
- Writing paragraphs strengthens my skills as a reader and listener. I'll become more aware of the ideas of other writers and speakers and the evidence they provide - or fail to provide - to support those ideas.
- Paragraph writing will make me a stronger thinker. Traditional paragraph writing will train my mind to think clearly.

When I write for others, it is crucial to know both my purpose for writing and the audience who will be reading my work.
- Purpose
	+ To **inform**: to give information about a subject. Authors writing to inform want to provide facts that will explain or teach something to readers. For example, an informative paragraph about sandwiches might begin, "Eating food between two slices of bread - a sandwich - is a practice that has its origins in eighteenth-century England."
	+ To **persuade**: to convince the reader to agree with the author's point of view on a subject. Authors writing to persuade may give facts, but their main goal is to argue or prove a point to readers. A persuasive paragraph about sandwiches might begin, "There are good reasons why every sandwich should be made with whole grain bread."
	+ To **entertain**: to amuse and delight; to appeal to the reader's senses and imagination. Authors write to entertain in various ways, through fiction and nonfiction. An entertaining paragraph about sandwiches might begin, "What I wanted was a midnight snack, but what I got was better - the biggest, most magical sandwich in the entire world."
- Audience
	+ How much does the audience already know about the subject?
		* If I assume that my readers know very little, I might bore them with too much basic information. But, if I assume that they know more than they do, you might confuse them by using unfamiliar technical terminology or neglecting to provide enough informative detail.
	+ Why might the reader need or want to read this material?
	+ Is my purpose simply to inform the audience? Or is it to convince readers of something as well?
	+ What type of language should be used? relaxed, friendly, and informal or more formal.

Writing as a skill, competent writing comes only from plain hard work - determination and sweat.

Writing as a process of discovery
- As you write, you may suddenly switch direction or double back.
- Writers frequently do not know their exact destination as they begin to write.

Keeping a daily or almost daily Journal
- Writing a journal will help me develop the habit of thinking on paper and will show me how ideas can be discovered in the process of writing
- A journal can make writing a familiar part of my life and can serve as a continuing source of ideas for papers.

## The four bases and the Writing Process
1. Discovering a point - often through prewriting.
2. Developing solid support for the point - often through more prewriting.
3. organizing the supporting material and writing it out in a first draft.
4. Revising and then editing carefully to ensure an effective, error-free paper.

1. If you make one point and stick to that point, your writing will have unity.
2. If you back up the point with specific evidence, your writing will have support.
3. If you organize and connect the specific evidence, your writing will have coherence.
4. If you write clear, error-free sentences, your writing will demonstrate effective sentence skills.

### Prewriting
#### Freewriting
You write on your topic for ten minutes.
- Do not worry about spelling or punctuating correctly, about erasing mistakes, about organizing material, or about finding exact words.
- You just write without stopping. If you get stuck for words, you write "I am looking for something to say" or repeat words until you think of something.

#### Questioning
You generate ideas and details by asking as many questions as you can think of about your subject. Such question include Why? When? Where? Who? How? In what ways?

#### Clustering
Clustering, also known as diagramming or mapping. Using lines, boxes, arrows, and circles to show relationships among the ideas and details.

### Scratch Outline
Point(Topic Sentence): ...
Supports(Statement Sentences):
Statement Sentence 1.
	Concrete Detail 1.
	Commentary 1. (your intellectual comments)
SS2.
	CD2.
	CM2.
SS3.
	CD3.
	CM3.

### Writing a First Draft
- Follow you scratch outline.
- Do not worry yet about grammar, punctuation, or spelling.
- New details and ideas may pop into you mind, just add the new information.

### Revising
Rewrite your paragraph, building upon what has already been done, in order to make it stronger.
- First: set your first draft aside for a while. You can then come back to it with a fresher, more objective point of view.
- Second: work with printed, double-spaced text.
- Third: read your draft aloud
- Four: write additional thoughts and changes above the lines or in the margins of your paragraph.

#### Revising Content
1. Is my paragraph **unified**?
2. Is my paragraph **supported**?
3. Is my paragraph **organized**?
	- Do I use transitions and other connecting words?

#### Revising Sentences
1. Do I use **parallelism** to balance my words and ideas?
2. Do I have a **consistent point of view**?
3. Do I use **specific** words?
4. Do I use **active** verbs?
5. Do I use words effectively by **avoiding slang, cliches, pretentious language**, and **wordiness**?
6. Do I **vary my sentences** in length and structure?

### Editing
Checking a paragraph for mistakes in grammar, punctuation, usage, and spelling.

### Using Peer Review
- Read partner's paragraph aloud.
- Check or circle the trouble spots.
- Make a scratch outline.

## Point and Supporting the point
### Begin with a point

### Support the point with specific evidence

## Writing in the Digital Age
- Each file contain all stages of the writing process:
	+ Prewriting: dim the screen of the monitor so that you can't see what you're typing. You won't have to worry about grammar or spelling or typing errors; instead, you can concentrate on getting down as many ideas and details possible about your subject.
	+ Scratch Outline: at any point in the prewriting, outlining you might want to do some Google searches to get ideas.
	+ First Draft
	+ Revising
	+ Editing and proofreading

Turn off any notification and turn on the full screen mode when writing.

The Library of Congress, in Washington, D.C., has copies of all books published in the United States. You can visit at [www.loc.gov][1]

### Evaluating Internet Sources
- Author
	+ What credentials does the author have?
	+ What academic degrees does he or she hold?
	+ Does the author work for a college, university, well-respected think tank, or research group?
	+ Has he or she published other material on the topic?
- Internal evidence
	+ Does the author seem to proceed objectively - presenting all sides of the issue fairly before stating his or her own views?
	+ Does the **sponsor** of the Web site seem to be an objective source?
	+ Does the author provide adequate support for his or her views?
	+ Was the article first published in a print version?
- Date
	+ Is the information up to date?

# Write an email - email etiquette
## Format
- Greeting
- Who you are?
- Your reason for writing
- Closing
- Signature

## Rules
### Greeting
- Starting email with: `Dear`, `Hello`, `Hi`
- Using first name in regular workplace, some upper-level prefer `Mr.` or `Ms.`, using `Dr.` for a medical doctor or professor for the first time. If you don't have a specific name for the recipient, a simple `Hello` is perfectly sufficient.

### Closing
- `Best`: easy to use
- `Best regards`: This phrase is professional, but with some warmth. It's common for business emails that are less formal, such as between co-workers who work together somewhat frequently. This can be shortened further to `Regards` when emailing someone familiar.
- `Sincerely`: This is a universal closing sentiment and appropriate in most situations, little bit old-fashion.
- `Thanks`: more familiar
- `Thanks so much`
- `Many thanks`
- `Thank you`: more formal
- `Respectfully`: This is a formal sendoff that's appropriate when emailing the CEO, Chairman of the Board, or a high-level company executive.
- `Fondly`: This is definitely a social closing, not a professional one, a level of familiarity.
- `Warm regards`: This is a more formal version of `fondly`, but it's still best suited for social emails.
- `Hope this helps`

### Signature
Make sure your signature line lists the basics: your full name, title, company name, and contact information, including phone numbers and email.

## Write an email to a professor
[How](http://www.wikihow.com/Email-a-Professor)

### Example
	Dear Professor XXX,

	I am a student at XXX College with a major in xxx.  I am a junior and will be graduating next May.  I have a 4.0 GPA and experience in our college’s summer program in xxx.

	I am planning to attend graduate school in xxx, with a focus on xxx.  In one of my classes, “xxx,” which was taught by Professor XXX, I had the chance to read your article, “xxxx.”  I really enjoyed it, and it gave me many ideas for my future research.  I have been exploring graduate programs where I can work on this topic.

	I hope you don’t mind my getting in touch, but I’d like to inquire whether you are currently accepting graduate students.  And if you are, if you’d be willing to talk to me a bit more, by email or on the phone, or in person if I can arrange a campus visit, about my graduate school plans.  I have explored your department’s graduate school website in detail, and it seems like an excellent fit for me because of its emphasis on xx and xx,  but I still have a few specific questions about xx and xxx that I’d like to talk to you about.

	I know you’re very busy so I appreciate any time you can give me.  Thanks very much,

	Sincerely,

	XX XXX

# Tips and Tricks
## past model verbs - could have, should have, would have
### could have + past participle
- could have + past participle means that something was possible in the past, or you had the ability to do something in the past, but that you didn't do it.
	+ I could have stayed up late, but I decided to go to bed early.
	+ They could have won the race, but they didn't try hard enough.
	+ Julie could have bought the book, but she borrowed it from the library instead.
	+ He could have studied harder, but he was too lazy and that's why he failed the exam.
- coudn't have + past participle means that something wasn't possible in the past, even if you had wanted to do it.
	+ I couldn't have arrived any earlier. There was a terrible traffic jam.
	+ He couldn't have passed the exam, even if he had studied harder. It's a really, really difficult exam.
- we want to make a guess about something that happened in the past. In this case, we don't know if what we're saying is true or not true. We're just talking about our opinion of what maybe happened.
	+ Why is John late? He could have got stuck in traffic.
	+ He could have forgotten that we were meeting today.
	+ He could have overslept.
- We can also choose to use `might have + past participle` to make a guess about something that happened in the past.
	+ He might have got stuck in traffic
	+ He might have forgotten that we were meeting today.
	+ He might have got stuck in traffic.

### Should have + past participle
- `should have + past participle` can mean something that would have been a good idea, but that you didn't do it. It's like giving advice about the past when you say it to someone else, or regretting what you did or didn't do when you're talking about yourself.
	+ I should have studied harder! (= I didn't study very hard and so I failed the exam. I'm sorry about this now.)
	+ I should have gone to bed early (= I didn't got to bed early and now I'm tired.)
- `shouldn't have + past participle` means that something wasn't a good idea, but you did it anyway.
	+ I shouldn't have eaten so much cake! (= I did eat a lot of cake and now i don't feel good.)
- `should have + past participle` to talk about something that, if everything is normal and okay, we think has already happened. But we're not certain that everything is fine, so we use 'should have' and not the present perfect or past simple. It's often used with 'by now'.
	+ His plane should have arrived by now (= if everything is fine, the plane has arrived).
	+ John should have finished work by now (= if everything is normal, John has finished work).
	+ Lucy should have arrived by now, but she hasn't.

### would have + past participle
- part of the `third conditional`
	+ If I had had enough money, I would have bought a car (but I didn't have enough money, so I didn't buy a car).
- to talk about something you wanted to do but didn't
	+ I would have gone to the party, but I was really busy. (= I wanted to go to the party, but I didn't because I was busy. If I hadn't been so busy, I would have gone to the party.)
	+ I would have called you, but I didn't know your number. (= I wanted to call you but I didn't know your number, so I didn't call you.)
	+ A: Nobody volunteered to help us with the fair
	+ B: I would have helped you. I didn't know you needed help. (= If I had known that you needed help, I would have helped you.)

## Position of `sometimes`
IMHO, meaning of your sentence depends on where you put the word "sometimes". Wherever you put it, it'll emphasise the words following it. I would interpret it as follows:

- **SOMETIMES it's good to go to the church** or **It's SOMETIMES good to go to the church** [implies a continuation like "...rather than stay in bed until noon"; here "SOMETIMES" relates to "good to go"]. (`This is more common`)

- "It's good to go SOMETIMES to the church" ["...and sometimes to the mosque", here "SOMETIMES" refers to "the church"].

- "It's good to go to the church SOMETIMES" ["... but not too often", "SOMETIMES" acts on its own]

**Some examples**

	I [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] like to answer questions about adverbs.
	I have [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] liked to answer questions about adverbs.
	I can [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
	I am [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.

You can add sometimes to any of the four lists above, but not to any of the four below.

	I do not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
	I have not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answered questions about adverbs.
	I can't [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] answer questions about adverbs.
	I am not [always / usually / often / frequently / regularly / generally] eager to answer questions about adverbs.

You can place sometimes at the beginning of any of the eight examples above.
