# Four noble truths

## 1. There is suffering and constant dissatisfaction in the world

## 2. This suffering is caused by desires

## 3. We can transcend suffering by managing these desires

- We must change our outlook, not our circumstances.
    + We don't happy not because we don't have enough money, love,
    status but because we greedy, vain and insecure. By re-orienting our
    mind we can growing to be content.
    + We can invert negative emotions and states of mind, turning
    ignorance into wisdom, angry into compassion, and greed into
    generosity.

## 4. The noble eithtfold path: a series of aspects of behaving "right" and wisely

- Right view
- Right intention
- Right speech
- Right action
- Right livelihood
- Right effort
- Right mindfulness
- Right concentration

Wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realization.

We must exercise one's nobler impulses on a regular basis, as one would
train a limb.
