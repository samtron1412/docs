# Overview

In practice, we find that unless these concerns are separated, larger
applications become difficult to maintain.

One way to separate concerns in a software application is to use a
Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
- The Model represents the business or database code
- The View represents the page design code
- The Controller represents the navigational code

Model-view-controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for
implementing user interfaces in web development.
