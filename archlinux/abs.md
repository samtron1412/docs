# Overview
The **Arch Build System** is a **ports-like** system for building and packaging software from source code.
- While `pacman` is the specialized Arch tool for binary package management (including packages built with the ABS), ABS is a collection of tools for compiling source into installable `.pkg.tar.xz` packages.
