# Overview

- Physics (from Ancient Greek "knowledge of nature") is the natural
science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior
through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and
force.
- One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of
physics is to understand how the universe behaves.
- Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest
through its inclusion of astronomy. Over the last two millennia, physics
was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry, biology, and
certain branches of mathematics, but during the scientific revolution in
the 17th century, the natural sciences emerged as unique research
programs in their own right.
- Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new
technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs.
