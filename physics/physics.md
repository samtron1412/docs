# Overview

- Physics (from Ancient Greek "knowledge of nature") is the natural
science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior
through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and
force.
- One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of
physics is to understand how the universe behaves.
- Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines, perhaps the oldest
through its inclusion of astronomy. Over the last two millennia, physics
was a part of natural philosophy along with chemistry, biology, and
certain branches of mathematics, but during the scientific revolution in
the 17th century, the natural sciences emerged as unique research
programs in their own right.
- Physics also makes significant contributions through advances in new
technologies that arise from theoretical breakthroughs.

# History

## Ancient astronomy [^history-astronomy]

Astronomy is the oldest of the natural sciences. The earliest
civilizations dating back to beyond 3000 BCE.

## Natural Philosophy [^natural-philosophy]

- Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic
  period, 650 BCE - 480 BCE, when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales
  rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and
  proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.
- They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of
  their hypotheses proved successful in experiment; for example, atomism
  was found to  be correct approximately 2000 years after it was first
  proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.

## Physics in the medieval Islamic world

- Developing early forms of the scientific method.
- The most notable work was **The Book of Optics**, written by Ibn
Al-Haitham:
    + The first studies the phenomenon of the pinhole camera.

## Classical physics

- Physics became a separate science when early modern Europeans used
experimental and quantitative methods to discover what are now
considered to be the laws of physics.
- Major developments:
    + The replacement of the geocentric model of the solar system with
      the heliocentric Copernican model.
    + The laws governing the motion of planetary bodies determined by
      Johannes Kepler between 1609 and 1619.
    + Pioneering work on telescopes and observational astronomy by
      Galileo Galilei in the 16th and 17th centuries.
    + Isaac Newton's discovery and unification of the laws of motion and
      universal gravitation. Newton also developed calculus.
    + The discovery of new laws in thermodynamics, chemistry, and
      electromagnetics resulted from greater research efforts during the
      industrial revolution as energy needs increased.

## Modern physics

- Modern physics began in the early 20th century with the work of Max
Planck in quantum theory and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity.
Both of these theories came about due to inaccuracies in classical
mechanics in certain situations.
    + Classical mechanics predicted a varying speed of light, which
      could not be resolved with the constant speed predicted by
      Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism; this discrepancy was
      corrected by Einstein's theory of special relativity, which
      replaced classical mechanics for fast-moving objects and allowed
      for a constant speed of light.
    + Black body radiation provided another problem for classical
      physics, which was corrected when Planck proposed that the
      excitation of material oscillators is possible only in discrete
      steps proportional to their frequency; this, along with the
      **photoelectric effect** and a complete theory predicting discrete
      **energy levels** of **electron orbitals**, led to the theory of
      quantum mechanics taking over from classical physics at very small
      scales.
- Quantum mechanics would come to be pioneered by Werner Heisenberg,
Erwin Schrodinger and Paul Dirac.
    + From this early work, and work in related fields, the Standard
      Model of particle physics [^standard-model] was derived.
    + Physics beyond the Standard Model [^beyond-sm].
    + Areas of mathematics are important to this field,
    such as the study of probabilities.

# Philosophy [^philosophy-physics]

- Physics stems from **ancient Greek philosophy**.
    + Thales' first attempt to characterize matter
    + Democritus' deduction that matter ought to reduce to an invariant
      state
    + The Ptolemaic astronomy of a crystalline firmament
    + Aristotle's book Physics (an early book on physics, which
      attempted to analyze and define motion from a philosophical point
      of view)
    + Physics was known as natural philosophy until the late 18th
      century.
- By the 19th century, physics was realized as a discipline distinct
  from philosophy and the other sciences.
    + Physics relies on **philosophy of science** and its **scientific**
      **method** to advance our knowledge of the physical world.
- Study of the philosophical issues surrounding physics involves issues:
    + the nature of space and time, **determinism**
    + metaphysical outlooks such as **empiricism**, **naturalism** and
      **realism**

# Research

## Scientific method

Physicists use the scientific method to test the validity of a physical
theory. By using a methodical approach to compare the implications of a
theory with the conclusions drawn from its related experiments and
observations, physicists are better able to test the validity of a
theory in a logical, unbiased, and repeatable way. To that end,
experiments are performed and observations are made in order to
determine the validity or invalidity of the theory.

A scientific law is a **concise verbal** or **mathematical statement**
of a relation which expresses a fundamental principle of some theory,
such as Newton's law of universal gravitation.

## Theory and experiment

Theorists seek to develop mathematical models that both agree with
existing experiments and successfully predict future experimental
results, while experimentalists devise and perform experiments to test
theoretical predictions and explore new phenomena. Although theory and
experiment are developed separately, they are strongly dependent upon
each other.

Progress in physics frequently comes about when experimentalists make a
discovery that existing theories cannot explain, or when new theories
generate experimentally testable predictions, which inspire new
experiments.

Theoretical physics has historically taken inspiration from philosophy.
Beyond the known universe, the field of theoretical physics also deals
with hypothetical issues, such as parallel universes, a multiverse, and
higher dimensions. Theorists invoke these ideas in hopes of solving
particular problems with existing theories. They explore the
consequences of these ideas and work toward making testable predictions.

Experimental physics expands, and is expanded by, engineering and
technology. Experimental physicists involved in basic research design
and perform experiments with equipment such as particle accelerators and
lasers, whereas those involved in applied research often work in
industry developing technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and transistors. Feynman has noted that experimentalists may seek
areas which are not well-explored by theorists.

## Scope and aims

Physics covers a wide range of phenomena, from elementary particles
(such as quarks, neutrinos, and electrons) to the largest superclusters
of galaxies. Included in these phenomena are the most basic objects
composing all other things.

Physics aims to describe the various phenomena that occur in nature in
terms of simpler phenomena. thus, physics aims to both connect the
things observable to humans to root causes, and then connect these
causes together.

### Particle physics

Particle physics is the study of the elementary constituents of matter
and energy and the interaction between them. In addition, particle
physicists design and develop the high energy accelerators, detectors,
and computer programs necessary for this research. Th field is also
called "high-energy physics" because many elementary particles do not
occur naturally but are created only during high-energy collisions of
other particles.

Currently, the interactions of elementary particles and fields are
described by the Standard Model. The model accounts for the 12 known
particles of matter (quarks and leptons) that interact via the strong,
weak, and electromagnetic fundamental forces. Dynamics are described in
terms of matter particles exchanging gauge bosons (gluons, W and Z
bosons, and photons, respectively). The Standard Model also predicts a
particle known as the Higgs boson. In July 2012 CERN, the European
laboratory for particle physics, announced the detection of a particle
consistent with the Higgs boson, an integral part of a Higgs mechanism.

Nuclear physics is the field of physics that studies the constituents
and interactions of atomic nuclei. The most commonly known applications
of nuclear physics are nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons
technology, but the research has provided application in many fields,
including those in nuclear medicine and magnetic resonance imaging, ion
implantation in materials engineering, and radiocarbon dating in geology
and archaeology.

### Atomic, molecular, and optical physics

Atomic, molecular, and optical physics (AMO) is the study of
matter-matter and light-matter interactions on the scale of single atoms
and molecules. The three areas are grouped together because of their
interrelationships, the similarity of methods used, and the commonality
of their relevant energy scales. All three areas include both classical,
semi-classical and quantum treatments; they can treat their subject from
a microscopic view (in contrast to a macroscopic view).

Atomic physics studies the electron shells of atoms. Current research
focuses on activities in quantum control, cooling and trapping of atoms
and ions, Low-temperature collision dynamics and the effects of electron
correlation on structure and dynamics. Atomic physics is influenced by
the nucleus (see, e.g., hyperfine splitting), but intra-nuclear
phenomena such as **fission and fusion** are considered part of high-energy
physics.

Molecular physics focuses on multi-atomic structures and their internal
and external interactions with matter and light. Optical physics is
distinct from optics in that it tends to focus not on the control of
classical light fields by macroscopic objects but on the fundamental
properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter in the
microscopic realm.
