# Overview
Physics terminology

# Distance
Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to "how much ground an object has covered" during its motion.

# Displacement
Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place an object is"; it is the object's overall **change in position**.

# Speed
Speed is a rate of change of distance with time interval. It's a scalar quantity that refers to "how fast an object is moving."

# Velocity
Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to "the rate of change of position with respect to time interval." It mean velocity is speed value combine with direction.

## Average velocity
Average velocity = change in position (displacement) / length of time interval.

## Instantaneous velocity
Instantaneous velocity is velocity of an object at a particular time. To estimate the instantaneous velocity at a particular time we can compute average velocity with time interval shrink to zero.

# Acceleration
Acceleration is a vector quantity that is defined as the rate at which an object changes its velocity. An object is accelerating if it is changing its velocity.

# Momentum

- Linear momentum (động lượng)
- Impulse (xung lượng)
- Angular momentum (mô men động lượng)
- Rotational inertia (mô men quán tính)
- Torque (mô men lực)
