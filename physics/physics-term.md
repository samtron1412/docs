# Overview

Physics terminology


# Mechanics
## Distance

Distance is a scalar quantity that refers to "how much ground an object
has covered" during its motion.

## Displacement

Displacement is a vector quantity that refers to "how far out of place
an object is"; it is the object's overall **change in position**.

## Speed

Speed is a rate of change of distance with time interval. It's a scalar
quantity that refers to "how fast an object is moving."

## Velocity

Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to "the rate of change of
position with respect to time interval." It mean velocity is speed value
combine with direction.

## Average velocity

Average velocity = change in position (displacement) / length of time
interval.

## Instantaneous velocity

Instantaneous velocity is velocity of an object at a particular time. To
estimate the instantaneous velocity at a particular time we can compute
average velocity with time interval shrink to zero.

## Acceleration

Acceleration is a vector quantity that is defined as the rate at which
an object changes its velocity. An object is accelerating if it is
changing its velocity.

## Momentum

- Linear momentum (động lượng)
- Impulse (xung lượng)
- Angular momentum (mô men động lượng)
- Rotational inertia (mô men quán tính)
- Torque (mô men lực)


# Electromagnetism

## Electron

The electron is a subatomic particle with a negative elementary electric
charge.

## Electron Hole

In physics, chemistry, and electronic engineering, an electron hole
(often simply called a hole) is the lack of an electron at a position
where one could exist in an atom or atomic lattice.
- This is an abstract concept: the vacancy of an electron at a position.

## Conductor

In physics and electrical engineering, a conductor is an object or type
of material that allows the flow of an electrical current in one or more
directions.
- Materials made of metal are common electrical conductors.
- Electrical current is generated by the flow of negatively charged
  electrons, positively charged holes, and positive or negative ions in
  some cases.

### Perfect conductor

A perfect conductor is an idealized material exhibiting infinite
electrical conductivity or equivalently zero resistivity.
- While perfect electrical conductors do not exist in nature, the
  concept is a useful model when electrical resistance is negligible
  compare to other effects.
- One example is ideal magnetohydrodynamics, the study of perfectly
  conductive fluids.
- another example is electrical circuit diagrams, which carry the
  implicit assumption that the wires connecting the components have no
  resistance.

### Semiconductor

A semiconductor material has an electrical conductivity value falling
between that of a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, such as
glass.
- Their resistance decreases as their temperature increases.
- Silicon, germanium, and compounds of gallium are the most widely used
  in electronic devices.

### Superconductivity

Superconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero electrical resistance
and expulsion of magnetic flux field occurring in certain materials,
called superconductors, when cooled below a characteristic critical
temperature.
- Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a
  quantum mechanical phenomenon.
- It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete ejection of
  magnetic field lines from the interior of the superconductor as it
  transitions into the superconducting state.
- The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity
  cannot be understood as the idealization of perfect conductivity in
  classical physics.


## Insulator

An electrical insulator is a material whose internal electric charges do
not flow freely; very little electric current will flow through it under
the influence of an electric field.

## Dielectric

A dielectric (or dielectric material) is an electrical insulator that
can be polarized by an applied electric field.
- When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do
  not flow through the material as they do in a electrical conductor,
  but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions
  causing dielectric polarization.
