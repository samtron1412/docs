# Terminology

- The Sagittal Plane: https://biologydictionary.net/sagittal-plane/
- DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid): double helix strand structure, each
  strand contains a long chain of codons (3 nucleotides), each codon
  corresponding to an amino acid
- RNA (Ribonucleic acid): single strand structure
- Chromosome: a long DNA molecule, this long molecule combined with
  histones proteins to protect its integrity
- Genome: all genetic material (nucleic acids: RNA and DNA) of an
  organism
- Gene: a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA that encodes the
  synthesis of a gene products (RNA or proteins).
- Genotype: the genetic material of an organism. Though, it is used to
  refer to a single gene or a set of genes. It determines the
  characteristic of observable traits.
- Phenotype: the observable traits of an organism
- Allele: It is a one of two or more versions of the same gene at the
  same place on a chromosome.
