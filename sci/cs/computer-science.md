# Overview

- Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and
  engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.
- Computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes
  that scale.
- It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its
  applications.
- It is the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression,
  and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that
  underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage,
  communication of, and access to information.

# History

## Binary logic

- In 1703, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz developed logic in a formal,
  mathematical sense with his writings on the binary numeral system.
- But it took more than a century before George Boole published his
  Boolean algebra in 1854 with a complete system that allowed
  computational processes to be mathematically modeled.

## Birth of the computer

## Emergence of a discipline

### Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace

### Alan Turing and Turing machine

### Shannon and information theory

### Wiener and cybernetics

### John von Newmann and the Von Newmann architecture

# Philosophy

## Three separate paradigms

- science, technology and mathematics
- theory, abstraction(modeling) and design
- rationalist paradigm (which treats computer science as a branch of
  mathematics, and mainly employs deductive reasoning); technocratic
  paradigm (which might be found in engineering approaches, most
  prominently in software engineering), and the "scientific paradigm"
  (which approaches computer-related artifacts from the empirical
  perspective of natural sciences).

## The great insights of computer science

- Leibniz's, Boole's, Alan Turing's, Shannon's, and Moore's Insight:
  There are only **two objects (0/1)** that a computer has to deal with
  in order to represent **anything**.
- [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing)'s Insight:
  There are only **five actions** that a computer has to perform in
  order to do **anything**. Every algorithm can be expressed in a
  language for a computer consisting of only five basic instructions:
    + move left one location
    + move right one location
    + read symbol at current location
    + print 0 at current location
    + print 1 at current location
- [Bohm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrado_B%C3%B6hm) and Jacophin's
  Insight: There are only **three ways of combining** these actions
  (into more complex ones) that are needed in order for a computer to do
  **anything**. Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic
  instructions into more complex ones:
    + sequence: first do this; then do that
    + selection: **if** such-and-such is the case, **then** do this,
      **else** do that
    + repetition: **while** such-and-such is the case **do** this
