# Overview

In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number
expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which
represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 and
1.
- Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic
  circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by
  almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.
- Each digit is referred to as a bit.

## History

- The modern binary number system was devised by Gottfried Leibniz in
  1679.
- Systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple
  cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was
  specifically inspired by the Chinese I Ching.
