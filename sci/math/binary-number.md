# Overview

In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number
expressed in the binary numeral system or base-2 numeral system which
represents numeric values using two different symbols: typically 0 and
1.
- Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic
  circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used internally by
  almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.
- Each digit is referred to as a bit.

## History

- The modern binary number system was devised by Gottfried Leibniz in
  1679.
- Systems related to binary numbers have appeared earlier in multiple
  cultures including ancient Egypt, China, and India. Leibniz was
  specifically inspired by the Chinese I Ching.

# Fractions

Fractions in binary only terminate if the denominator has 2 as the only
prime factor. As a result, 1/10 does not have a finite binary
representation, and this cause 10 x 0.1 not to be precisely equal to 1
in floating point arithmetic.

| Fraction | Decimal            | Binary             | Fractional approximation |
| -        | -                  | -                  | -                        |
| 1/1      | 1 or 0.999...      | 1 or 0.111...      | 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...    |
| 1/2      | 0.5 or 0.4999...   | 0.1 or 0.0111...   | 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...   |
| 1/3      | 0.333...           | 0.010101...        | 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + ...  |
| 1/4      | 0.25 or 0.24999... | 0.01 or 0.00111... | 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + ...  |
