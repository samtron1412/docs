# Overview
Mathematics terminology

# Algebra

Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for
manipulating these symbols.
- study of operations and their application to solving equations
- It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study
  of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields.
- The most basic parts of algebra are called *elementary algebra*; the
  more abstract parts are called *abstract algebra*.
    + Elementary algebra differes from arithmetic in the use of
      abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are
      either unknown or allowed to take on many values.

# Arithmetic

Arithmetic is a branch of mathematics dealing with the properties and
manipulation of numbers.
- Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory.

# Asymptote

An asymptote of a curve is a line such that the distance between the
curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity.

# Calculus

study of change

# Cartesian coordinate

A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each
point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical coordinates, which are
the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed
lines, measured in the same unit of length.

# Derivative

- Rates of change
- Slope of tangent line = limit of slopes of secant line
- Limit of a difference quotient.
    + f'(a) = limit when x -> a of [f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a)
    + f'(x) = limit when h -> 0 of [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h

# Determinant

# Difference quotient

Difference quotient is slope of secant line.
Formula: [f(x) - f(a)]/(x - a)

# Differential calculus

finding tangent lines to curves

# Differentiation

Process of computing derivative.

# Discriminant

# Function

In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a
set of permissible outputs with the property that each input is related
to exactly one output.

## Domain

set of inputs

## Image (Range)

set of outputs

## Graph

set of all input-output pairs

## Zero (Root)

is a x value such that: f(x) = 0

## Piecewise function

f(x) = 5 if x < 0
f(x) = 6x + 7 if x = 0
f(x) = 7x if x >0

A function with definition as above is a piecewise function.

# Geometry

study of shape

# Homogeneous coordinate

Homogeneous coordinates are a system of coordinates used iin projective
geometry, as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry.

# Hypotenuse

In geometry, a hypotenuse is the longest side of a right-angled
triangle, the side opposite of the right angle.

# Integral calculus

computing areas under curves

# Interval

- Closed: [a,b]
- Open: (a,b)
- Half-open: [a,b) or (a,b]

# Limit

Suppose that f(x) is defined for all x in an open interval containing c
(but not necessarily at x = c). Then

    lim f(x) as x approaches c equal L

if for all epsilon > 0, there exist delta > 0 such that

    |f(x) - L| < epsilon if 0 < |x - c| < delta

> Intuitively, when x approaches c then f(x) approaches L.

# Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and
linear mappings between such spaces.

# Linear Map

A linear map (also called a linear mapping, linear transformation, or
linear function) is a mapping V->W between two modules (including vector
spaces) that preserves the operations of addition and scalar
multiplication.

# Map

Mapping, or map, referes to either a function, often with some sort of
special structure, or a morphism in category theory, which generalizes
the idea of a function.

# Number

an arithmetical value, expressed by a word, symbol, or figure,
representing a particular quantity and used in counting and making
calculations and for showing order in a series or for identification.

- Natural numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,...
- Whole numbers = natural numbers + zero = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,...
- Integers: negative natural numbers + whole numbers = ...,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,...
- Rational numbers: ratio of integers
- Irrational numbers: the ones can't be written as fractions
- Real numbers: Irrational + Rational
- Imaginary numbers (complex numbers)

# Rate of change

Rate of change play a role whenever we study the relationship between
two changing quantities. Velocity is a familiar example (the rate of
change of position with respect to time)

## Average rate of change

The average rate of change of y=f(x) over an interval [x0,x1]:

Average rate of change = [f(x1) - f(x0)] / [x1 - x0]

> Average rate of change is the slope of the secant line through the
> points (x0,f(x0)) and (x1,f(x1)) on the graph of f(x)

## Instantaneous rate of change

Instantaneous rate of change is limit of the average rates of change.

> Instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent line at x0.

# Scalar

Scalars are quantities that are fully described by a magnitude (or
numerical value) alone.

# Secant lines

The term secant line refers to a line through two points on a curve.

# Tangent lines

You can think of a tangent line as a line that skims a curve at a point.

# Triangle inequality

In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle,
the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to
the length of the remaining side.

In Euclidean geometry and some other geometries, the triangle inequality
is a theorem about distances, and it is written using vectors and vector
lengths (**norms**):

||x+y|| <= ||x|| + ||y||

Absolute value: |x+y| <= |x| + |y|

# Trigonometric identities

Trigonometric identities are equalities that involve trigonometric
functions and are true for every single value of the occurring variables
where both sides of the equality are defined.

# Unit circle

A unit circle is a circle with a radius of one. In trigonometry, the
unit circle is the circle of radius one centered at the origin (0, 0) in
the Cartesian coordinate system in the Euclidean plane.

![Unit circle with common angles](../graphic/math/unit-circle-common-angles.svg)

# Vector

Vectors are quantities that are fully described by both a magnitude and
a direction.
