# Overview

Algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for
manipulating these symbols.
- study of operations and their application to solving equations
- It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study
  of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields.
- The most basic parts of algebra are called *elementary algebra*; the
  more abstract parts are called *abstract algebra*.
    + Elementary algebra differes from arithmetic in the use of
      abstractions, such as using letters to stand for numbers that are
      either unknown or allowed to take on many values.
