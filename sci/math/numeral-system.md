# Overview

A numeral system (or system of numeration) is a writing system for
expressing numbers.
- Ideally, a numeral system will:
    + Represent a useful set of numbers (e.g. all integers, or rational
      numbers)
    + Give every number represented a unique representation (or at least
      a standard representation)
    + Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers.
