# Overview

Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events.
- A random sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does
  not follow an intelligible pattern or combination.
- Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many
  cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of
  events (or trials) is predictable.
    * For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular
      roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as
      4.
    * In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an
      outcome, rather than haphazardness (randomness), and applies to
      concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.

# Monte Carlo Method

Monte Carlo methods are a broad class of coputational algorithms that
rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
- The essential idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be
  deterministic in principle.
- It is often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most
  useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches.
- Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes:
  optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a
  probability distribution.

In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are useful for
simulating systems with many coupled degrees of freedom, such as fluids,
disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures

In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem
having a probability interpretation.
- By the law of large numbers, integrals described by the expected value
  of some random variable can be approximated by taking the empirical
  mean of independent samples of the variable.
- When the probability distribution of the variable is parametrized,
  mathematicians often use a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. The
  central idea is to design a judicious Markov chain model with a
  prescribed stationary probability distribution.
