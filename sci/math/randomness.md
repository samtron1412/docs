# Overview

Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events.
- A random sequence of events, symbols or steps has no order and does
  not follow an intelligible pattern or combination.
- Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but in many
  cases the frequency of different outcomes over a large number of
  events (or trials) is predictable.
    * For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular
      roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as
      4.
    * In this view, randomness is a measure of uncertainty of an
      outcome, rather than haphazardness (randomness), and applies to
      concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy.
