# Overview

Mathematics (from Greek, "knowledge, study, learning") is the language
of universe and the natural basic science.

# History

## Etymology

# Definitions of Mathematics

## Normal definitions

- Mathematics is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers),
  structure, space, and change.

## Greater abstraction - Philosophical definitions

- Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions.

# Inspiration and aesthetics


# Notation, language, and rigor

# Fields of Mathematics

- Mathematics can be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure,
space, and change (i.e. arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and analysis).
- In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions.

## Foundations

### Mathematical logic

Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the
applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics.

### Set theory

Set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections
of objects.

### Category theory

Category theory, which deals in an abstract way with mathematical
structures and relationships between them, is still in development.

### Theory of computation

In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of
computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can
be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is
divided into three major branches: automata theory and language,
computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are
linked by the question: "What are the fundamental capabilities and
limitations of computers?"

# Mathematical awards

- Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the Fields
  Medal, established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around
  World War II) to as many as four individuals.

# [Mathematical Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics)

# Mathematical Model

- A mathematical model is a description of a system using mathematical
  concepts and language.
    + Mathematical models are used in the natural sciences such as
      physics, biology, chemistry, etc. and engineering disciplines such
      as computer science, as well as in the social sciences such as
      economics, psychology, sociology, political science.
