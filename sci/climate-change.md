# Overview

TL;DR: When CO2 was 280ppm the amount of heat radiated back into space
on a daily basis was the same as it is now, and as it will continue to
be no matter the CO2 levels. The difference is that green house gasses
cause a delay in releasing atmospheric heat, thus warming the
atmosphere. This in turn puffs up the water vapor part of the water
cycle, trapping more water in the atmosphere. Since water vapor is ~80%
of the GHG effect, it's far more important than CO2 itself. CO2 is just
a catalyst to enhance water vapor presence (the paintbrush, not the
paint), and the more CO2 the more water vapor. Without excess (>280ppm)
CO2, the cycle would fairly quickly return to normal, but as long as
there is too much the triggering will continue. Remember, the sun's
input to us doesn't vary, but instead of heating the surface and then
radiating back out at night, it's heating the atmosphere. And the
atmosphere can't rid itself of the extra heat that wouldn't normally (a
few decades ago) be there. More CO2 means more heat trapped in the
atmosphere, but it's the same amount of heat we've always received.

Again, the problem is not how atmospherically high up CO2 is in
concentration, it's how it affects the water cycle in the lower
layers. There could be bad effects of higher concentrations up there,
but they wouldn't have the same effects as in the lower layers, and
that's where the problem we know about is. There have been much higher
concentrations in the lower layers in the past, so saying we've reached
"saturation" is a lie, and no scientist with any integrity would claim
this.

- CO2 molecule can absorb infrared light due to its vibration that
  creates dipole moment (polar molecules) that will interact with
  electromagnetic waves.
    + But why only infrared light?
- Green house effect of a glass house
    + Sun light hit plants and things inside the green house.
    + Plants and things inside absorb sun light (visible lights) and
      emit infrared lights.
    + Glass absorb most of the infrared light and heat up the air inside
      the green house.
- Green house effect of the earth
    + Some sun light is absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, some are
      reflected back by the surface, but some are absorbed by Earth's
      surface.
    + Earth's surface after absorbing sun light will emit infrared light
      to the atmosphere.
    + Green house gases (water vapor, methane, CO2, etc.) near the
      surface absorb infrared light and turn it into heat and
      subsequently emit infrared light to the above layer of the
      atmosphere, and then higher layer of green house gases absorb
      these infrared light again. Hence, green house gases slow down the
      infrared dissipation process and increase the temperature.
- Stratospheric cooling
    + Stratosphere absorb some incoming sun light (ultraviolet) so the
      temperature is going up if we keep going higher.
    + Additional green house gases in stratosphere can emit infrared
      light if it wiggles, so stratosphere is better as cooling
    + The evidence of stratosphere cooling confirm that the warming is
      not due to solar radiation but by the green house gases.
- Analogy
    + CO2 is the trigger/starter/catalyst/heating element that transfer
      energy from infrared light to others molecules (O2, N2) or reemit
      infrared light.
        * More CO2 will slow down the process of heat dissipation to
          outer space similar as our body temperature is constant but if
          we put on a blanket then we feel warmer than without once. The
          same amount of heat/energy but the blanket trap/slow down the
          heat dissipation and increase the temperature.
        * This is the trigger for the more water vapor (the positive
          feedback) to make things worse.
    + Water vapor is the main driver of greenhouse effect.
        * More water vapor is caused by warming, and then it is a
          positive feedback to amplify the warming effect like domino
          effect.

    + The rate of pumping CO2 to the atmosphere is important.
