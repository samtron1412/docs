# Using PowerPoint

## Planning

- List of sections: Abstract, Introduction, Background, Methods,
  Results, Conclusion, Future Work, Acknowledgment, References
- A sketch on paper of your poster
- Whenever possible, represent materials graphically rather than
  textually
- For reader comfort, plan content in vertical columns rather than
  horizontal rows
- Consider your color choices carefully
    + white background, black text, and other light colors for figures

## Set the slide size

- Please be aware that PowerPoint’s maximum size is 52”; therefore to
  produce a PowerPoint poster with dimensions larger than 52”, both
  dimensions are entered at half the desired size. For example, for a
  44” x 66” poster, you would enter 22” in the box for height and 33” in
  the box for width, and click OK. The poster’s size will be doubled
  during the printing phase to bring it up to 44x66 inches as desired.

## Colors

- White and lighter colors work better

## Insert texts

- Times New Roman, or similar fonts
- Avoid capital or underlined texts
- If you need to cut and paste text, use `Paste Special` under the Edit
  menu. If you just use paste, the text will not be editable.
- Let text wrap in the text box. Do not use a hard return at the end of
  each line of text, only at the end of a paragraph. Use only soft
  returns (shift+ return) if you must manually put in a line break
- Insert image place holder boxes, by drawing rectangles as placeholders
  for your images after you have placed all the text and know how much
  room you have for the images.
- Title: 85-120 pt.
- Subtitle: 48-80 pt.
- Section headers: 36-72 pt.
- Body text: 24-48 pt.

## Prepare images

- Resolution of images should be 125-225 dpi (which will be 250-450 dpi
  when your poster is printed at 200%). File format should be TIFF, PDF
  or JPG . For line art, text, illustrations or cartoons, 225 dpi is a
  good resolution.
- Do not use WordArt in your poster. It does not look as good when
  printed large

## Insert images

- Always Insert your images (pictures, illustrations) rather than using
  Copy, Paste into PowerPoint
- If you are inserting tables, graphs or illustrations from another
  Microsoft Office application, use copy and then Paste Special into
  your poster

## Fine-tuning

- Add borders
- Add or change a fill

## Printing a small version

To see how your poster looks on paper, you can actually scale it to fit
on a standard 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper. I recommend that you do this,
because ...

- it's a good way to print and check your work, without wasting a huge
  sheet of paper
- if you can't read it on the 8.5x11 page, your font is too small
- it makes a great handout.

To scale to 8.5x11, go to File / Print ...

PC: Make sure your regular printer is selected. At the bottom of the
dialog box is a checkbox that says Scale to fit paper -- check it and
go.
