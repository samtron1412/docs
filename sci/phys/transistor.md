# Overview

A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch
electronic signals and electrical power.
- It consists of semiconductor material usually with at least three
  terminals for connection to an external circuit.
- A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals
  controls the current through another pair of terminals.
- Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the
  controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal.
  (Amplifier)
- Alternatively, the transistor can be used to turn current on or off in
  a circuit as an electrically controlled switch, where the amount of
  current is determined by other circuit elements. (Switch)
- Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are
  found embedded in integrated circuits.
- The transistor is the fundamental building block of modern electronic
  devices, and is ubiquitous in modern electronic systems.
