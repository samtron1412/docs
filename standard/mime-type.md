A media type (also MIME type and content type) is a two-part identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted on the Internet.

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority) is the official authority for the standardization and publication of these classifications.

Media types were first defined in [RFC 2045](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt)
