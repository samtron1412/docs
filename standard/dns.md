# Overview

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming
system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the
Internet or a private network.

- It translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP
addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer
services and devices with the underlying network protocols.
